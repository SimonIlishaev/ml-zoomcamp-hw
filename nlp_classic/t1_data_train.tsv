19	Use too much battery life I am just at home and it had 89% since morning and only use it for 30 mins max Once its night tine and i want to play Its on 30%	1
20	Have tried once again to activate this app..once again it will not allow me to continue past the first section...I give up . It can't be too important ...no one appears to be correcting the fault ,which judging by the reviews, many others are also experiencing .	2

26	App seems to work fine. All those having issue with "Invalid Phone Number" try turning your wifi on. For some reason that worked for me.	2
27	After update, daily area wise cases has been disabled under "Radius alert". Pls recheck.	2
28	Works well, does what it says on the label. I have my phones gps turned off and COVIDSafe still works so it does not care about your location and does no even ask for access. Easy to setup. Negligible battery usage does not even show in my top 10 battery users. A+++	0

31	Absolute battery killer.	1
32	Unable to install app on oppo A9. Can't be found on app store. Error says "app not available in the region".	2
33	draining battery, forced by the government with no overall results EDIT: battery drainage is not objective (actually showing 0% battery usage no matter how long since the last full recharge), but reported by many that with the app on, battery lasts way shorter time; app is also not "forced" but heavily recommended by many experts, unfortunatelly data are not used basically at all as acknowledged by govt itself	1
34	good	0
35	Everything works well with the app for contact tracing but having the option to put when you got to a place AND when you left would be good and people would probably be more likely to keep trace of that rather than putting it in the details section.	0
36	Arogya Setu nice app	0
37	Is not correct	1
38	Received OTP and has entered it. However, it keep saying wrong OTP. I have double and triple check that OTP entered correctly. Please resolve.	2
39	Despite countless feedback about battery consumption since it's inception, nothing has been done to address this problem. Stop wasting people's time by asking for details of our phone's firmware as I do not see anyone addressing the issue of battery drainage till now. Huge disappointment in this programme as well as wasting tax payers money paying for it as problems unsolved for months. If it's not ready, do not force the people into a corner to make it mandatory.	1
40	Easy to install and works to take care of you while you go on with life ...	0

42	Super	0
43	Great idea, but this is still a totally useless application! After ongoing issues with Bluetooth interuption, location permission issues, constant notifications of not working bla bla. Why would this not be attended to with commitment and urgency? It makes me question if this battery draining waste of memory space app was ever at all considered as a serious tracing tool considering the lack of effort put into making it functional?! I wished this worked and could help keep our community safe!	1

45	After completing of 14 days of quarantine, ehteraz app is showing yellow.Then I raised complaint to 109,issued ticket and I get call from team.ehteraz changed into green after 7days . They said it will change in 14days .But it is changed earlier.	1
46	Why are you asking the S-Pass Serial No? People waiting for S-Pass card delivery or collection are unable to register in this application. Please reply how people can register without S-Pass Serial No.	2
47	It's irritating, because you want to do the right thing - but I don't leave my Bluetooth on 24/7. Not for battery reasons but multiple different connectivity reasons. So this is super frustrating. Use my location instead of Bluetooth. \ud83d\ude02	1
48	OK thanks	0
49	Please can you help anyone. I downloaded in my phone but it was not working anymore \ud83d\ude14 I don't know why	1

60	Simple to install easy to use. do your bit and support the country getting back to normal. If you seriously think this is an affront to your civil liberties, well you better throw away your smart phone, pull out your phone line and live off-grid. I ask people to get real and consider that the means of tracking you are all around us, this app makes zero difference to that but could help us contain a second wave.	0

66	Simple, but works as advertised.	0
67	Used only 2% battery in 24 hours. Good privacy model in only locally storing the information and you having to manual upload the deidentified data if you test positive.	0
68	I can't not find my country in this app. Venezuela. You need add. Or someone explainme what I can do?... My Russian girlfriend has all correct, because Russia appear in the list	2

71	Good idea but sceptical on how well it'll work time will tell.	0
72	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0
73	Would maybe give an actual review if it worked. Instead I can't even start using it - getting "internet issues" no matter of I use WiFi or mobile	2
74	As expected hard on batteries but generally works well and may save lives	0
75	Great app. Helps keep the Rona away!	0
76	Updation of data on App is sluggish!	1
77	The app is stupid as frick! First of all one shouldn't be allowed to input a false name you idiots. Secondly it is telling me "an invalid phonenumber". Do you know my number? No you don't. I know it. It is valid believe you me! Twice it happens out of 2 tries. Pretty bad!	1
78	Battery use it still quite extensive. However on a side note, if mobile network signal is bad or down, the app might not be able to connect to read and register the qr code right? Will there be a TT qr code in the app similar to the token for the personnel at the venue to scan?	1
79	It will not work unless all permissions are obtained such as "Bluetooth, Location, Camera &Storage" if any of these not allowed it will show you nothing. \u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645 \u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0637\u064a \u062a\u0635\u0631\u064a\u062d \u0644\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0648\u062a\u0648\u062b \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0648\u0643\u064a\u0634\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u0643\u0631\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0639\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0634\u062a\u063a\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0643 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0630\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u062a\u0645 \u0645\u0639\u0644\u0642	1

108	Suggest to allow app to support older version of andriod if possible. Have a fully functional phone of 4 plus years and hoping not to change it just so I could use the QR code function.	2
109	Clean and neat as it should be	0
110	Waste	1
111	I sat in a shop for 1.5 hours and I had 300+ close contacts during this period, even though there was not that many people around and minimal traffic outside. How is this even possible? There should be better filtering else this is just providing useless data and causing inconvenience if one of these hundreds of supposed "close contacts" happen to fall sick!	1
112	It would be good if you give us detail information. The location, or something like that. And I find out so hard to update the data, always loading and nothing. Also, this morning suddenly the App close by himself, repeatedly. I couldnt update the data until now and I uninstall the app. *sigh*	1

121	So many time removed and again installed app. But PLEASE UPDATE YOUR APP message does not disappeared.	1
122	Very poor app... Useless	1
123	It is not intrusive for my privacy. All info is locally on my phone and I have to give permission to use it. That I would do because it is more important to keep the virus at bay and save lives then my personal privacy. I do not mind giving up info on my travels if it helps to find possible infected people or let me know if I was near an infected person so I could be quarantined until it is known if I got infected or not so I will not infect others possible even if I don't get symptoms or not. It is not because I am concerned for my own life but I am concerned that I could possibly infect people in “so-called RISK groups” that some seem to think is justifiable to sacrifice because it is too costly or even too inconvenient for those not at risk. Who are these people the “so-called RISK groups” that some think are not worth saving from Covid-19 because it is too costly or inconvenient for so many and justified as dispensable because they are “mostly” elderly or with “underlying conditions”. The so-called RISK groups, sometimes referred to as the vulnerable often “LABELED” as people with "underlying conditions" and; That includes; cancer patients, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, people on various immunosuppressant medicines for various reasons such as people that have undergone organ transplant, people with BEHCET'S disease, Crohn's disease or various other common autoimmune diseases that have to take immunosuppressant medicines and people with suppressed immune system for different reasons and group that is mostly mentioned as if that JUSTIFIES not taking radical approach the elderly (senior citizens). That is the group that is mostly mentioned by decision makers as the people with "underlying conditions" .	0

139	The app now appears to be working - thanks for your kind attention! When I try to view my test results the app tells me my phone number is not registered, and to log in with a number that is not mine. How can this be, when the initial log-in required my correct phone number! Very frustrating, as we are required to use this app! What are we supposed to do? How do we get our information - to know we are well, and not contagious? This app is a big fail!	0

144	The app is very commendable knowing that it tracks the safety of the residence of Qatar. But, on my phone when you open the app, it redirects to a reminder that "EHTERAZ keeps stopping". I cannot open the app. I hope this problem can be fixed. Thanks.	0

180	Sorry, I like the app :)	1
181	Uses way too much battery for the function it is trying to achieve. Awarding 1 Star for effort, 0 stars for the app. The app is so bad at battery efficiency even after so many months since it's original release, it makes one kind of look forward to carrying the turd of a trace together device instead.	1

195	The app keeps telling that 'exceeded code of activation'. What does this mean? What should I do?	2
196	App won’t even allow me to log on, even after multiple attempts. App will either not resend login authentication code, or refuses to accept the code that it sent! WHY AM I REQUIRED TO USE AN APP THAT IS COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE?	2

267	This app is bs, add mobile number says that it is invalid. How ridiculous and unhelpful in ever way. No point giving any rating when you can't pass step 2 because the design flaws. But to post this i have to give a star. Really it's worth 0 stars straight out honestly.	2
268	Please allow detecting contacts across a phone "backup, wipe, restore" sequence, as the backup app reported that you don't. Desired bonus featue: Basic stats display like "Active for XX hours with XX different IDs, XXX anonymous contact IDs recorded, 0 contact IDs were infectious, you are NOT registered as infected, latest list of infectIous IDs downloaded yesterday at HH:MM".	2

290	Is your application secretly listening to our conversation? Why is there a weird notification from google stored in a secure folder when I installed this application?

315	I concur with some comments made about the latest update. It seems to use more battery, and there are occasionally issues with Bluetooth functionality. I use a Huawei Y5. My biggest beef is that since adding covidsafe, I have found my Facebook Lite app doesn't work properly. FB can't post or upload photos. Maybe there is a setting on the covidsafe app, which when switched on or off, will fix this annoyance. I wish I knew.	1
316	It's good but, i can't chang my password.	2
317	Must connect mobile data and bluetooth to be traced. Wasting my money on my mobile bill! \ud83d\ude21	1
318	Drained my battery to zero after using from 10 am to 5 pm. So changing to 3 star rating. Only 1 step to scan QR code for check in. And check out from your app- no need to scan again. PLUS save your frequent visited location under FAVORITES and just tap for immediate check in. No need to look for QR code at the location. SUPER - group check in for family. No need to scan one by 1.

326	If you want to encourage people to download this app, then don't cheap out on production. Everytime Android has an update this thing stops working and crash reports keep interrupting my device's normal operation. Had to uninstall.

340	There are two mistakes, You have to solve it- 1. Using Bluetooth. (Remove Bluetooth Permission) 2. No update information on the app.When I pick an item It sows to open browser.Even, There is no informative tools in the app.All things depend on website. ( Add update news, without opening browser)	0

384	Just another useless app! Never helped to save or prevent even a single case of covid19 in Australia. People who designed and developed this app should be subject to further investigation for wasting tax payers' money.	2
385	My phone number has been deemed invalid so I can't sign up	2
386	The app keeps telling me I have an invalid phone number. I know I have entered it correctly. I have uninstalled & reinstalled, even restarted my phone. I don't ever have voice mail set up, could this possibly have anything to do with it ? I have an android phone.	2
387	hi, after the Oct 28 update, my QR code scanner inside the App is no longer working. Scan multiple QR safe entry code and none successful. Lucky I have saved common places I go as favourite. Please check.	2

397	double check entered otp and phone no. even though is correct, app doe not seem to respond	2
398	Had to delete it yesterday because my battery was drained in about 2 hours. Phone won't charge fast enough to keep up with the battery drainage. Looked like an easy to use app so hopefully it can be fixed to resolve the battery drainage issue.	1

432	I have a Huawei p40 Pro. After installing the app l get a notification that l must upgrade. If you try a message states upgrade no longer available. At that point you cannot log in. Thus everything stops hence total failure. Further to your reply please note l downloaded the app in full. Upon entering the app the message l noted appeared. The message stated to add an upgrade. When l tried to upgrade a further message stated... No upgrade available. At that point the app stalls l have 256gb internal plus additional 128gb of memory. So more than enough. The issue is this so called upgrade which is in addition to the NHS app and the fact the upgrade has supposedly expired and is no longer available.	2

459	Agree with other reviews. Battery drain started on 8th August is making my phone unusable. Will have to uninstall app which is a pity, as I think its a great idea.	1
460	I installed this when it first came out. I’ve opened the app a few times. It always says it was updated 1 minute ago. When I check a few minutes later it says the same. Either it checks every minute, or it’s a glitch. I just uninstalled/reinstalled.... we’ll see what happens.	2
461	It tells me it's installed, but I can't see it anywhere. Took numerous attempts to get this far, giving up on it until they sort it out. Why are so many apps only half-finished on release?	1
462	Good	0
463	Drains to much battery with Bluetooth on all the time. In spite my data privacy concerns, I think it is a good move to improve contact tracing but the app could provide a list of the places, with date and time, where I checked in for my own control. It is already collecting my info so why not allow me to access it?	1
464	Very helpful	0
465	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0
466	they taking information and want permission for too much	1

500	This is one of the worst apps ever by UAE. The results don't get automatically updated. You have to call specifically to inform that please update my results. This is just a useless application being promoted. Not at all useful THE GREAT ALHOSN APP. Will uninstall it.	1
501	Tried to download but failed every time gave up.	2
502	The initiative is commendable and the app's serverless architecture itself is great having used firebase thus enabling the quick rollout. But there has been this bug wherein it affects my Bluetooth earbuds (they keep pausing and playing affecting the quality). I tested it out by force stopping the application and the earbuds worked just fine, restarted the app again and had the same issue. I'm still using the app considering the situation at hand. But would be really great if the bug is fixed.	2
503	I did not monitor it.	1

512	OTP does not seem to be working on newer Huawei phone series, for example Huawei Nova. It is ridiculous to believe that the developer of this app is not able to able to develop something that is compatible with the phone series that are being sold in Singapore when the Government is encouraging citizens to use this app.	2
513	I still do not receive the OTP to my phone number. Same for some of my colleagues.	2
514	App pretty much destroyed my battery. Overheated my phone and drained it constantly. Cleared my cache and uninstalled the app it didn't work. Have to send it away for repairs. Considering the purpose of the app not only disappointing but honestly ridiculous	1
515	When i open ehteraz every time asking registration now show me Exceeded numbers of activation please contact 109. Please clear this issue.	2
516	I think is very useful but unfortunately, you can't change the language and it draines your battery, I will have to uninstall.	1
517	Good thank you	0
518	The Battery Optimisation option says it's on but needs me to allow the permission every time I open the app. Even when I allow it, it will turn itself off when I'm trying to use it out, and then make the app not active. It causes me great concern.	1
519	Useless, crashes continuously	1
520	I can't get past the first screen. There is a button that says 'I want to help' but no other options. I'm trying to find a skip option, but there is nothing. I'm not doing this because I 'want to'.	2
521	Just ridiculous. Setting up is complicated, connecting is complicated, operating is complicated. Oh come on! Give a nice juicy slap to the app creator from me!	0
522	This is the worst app I've ever come across. It is difficult to download , in the first instance. In spite of following all the technical details needed to upload this app , there is a constant error message . It would be useful if the technical support is available and also if these technical hick-ups are resolved to enhance functionality.	1

524	Cannot make it active	2
525	After having this app in Vancouver for over a month. It still says ‘no reporting in your area. \n\nCompletely disappointed that this app is dead on BC. One would think this limitation would be resolved. If you can’t report what good is the app?\n\nThanks Canada for leaving BC with ‘nothing’.	1

A powerful tool to anonymously assist with covid track and trace efforts on the island of Ireland, it alerts you where possible if your phone has been detected to have been close to someone else with the app who has reported symptoms. All done in a de-centralised way in which you retain control of your data, via anonymous keys, and choose what to share if anything. Easy to use and understand interface. And open source. Great stuff.	0
557	Why the hell do we need to turn on Bluetooth? Also explain why the Bluetooth notification does not go away. It is annoying, stop it... it is stupid to have to force open the Bluetooth when there is nothing there. The app is just wasting Bluetooth battery.	1
558	It dosnot sent OTP number. I try lot of times it dosent works.	2
559	Why is always apen blouthooth and location to use more charge.	1
560	It's good to track people's covid 19 status but drains the phone battery quickly	0
561	Well.......	0
562	Treasure battery juice over health safety. I am now required to charge my phone twice a day after using this app. Overall this app is okay. Hopefully developers can include covid-19 news update rather than just tracing purpose, this would my battery consumption worth.	1
563	I have been using this app since it's was launched, suddenly yesterday it stopped working only showing a question mark?I have deleted and installed it more than ten times but nothing plz fix this issue \ud83d\ude14	2
564	Surprisingly good! 1) A very good translation in English contrary to what some people say (but my whole OS is in English including Google Play store) 2) And this app uses very little battery on my OnePlus, less than 1% in a background mode (comparing to other apps which uses between 2 and 13%) 3) Functioning and the data usage and privacy are well explained Then, hopefully it'll keep its promise	0
565	Excellent	0
566	Install this app with my particular fill up but cannot log in at all.Please help	2
567	Its good to see cases and all things about Coronavirus	0

570	Worst	1
571	Pathetic. Getting the pin number managed to wipe out where the site bead to down load. Now will have to start again. Why isn't this made simpler?	0
572	App has added many useful and convenient features. Keep up the good work! It would be good if this app can add the feature to generate a QR code for user ID no. just like the one on the TraceTogether Tag so that it can be scanned by older scanner.	0

581	It does not work on HuaWei P40Pro. Stuck on get opt page.	2
582	Very informative	0
583	I installed the app and got in my car to go to the shop my car turned off whilst I was driving and before you ask its a brand new car... it stopped 5 times (The shop is two blocks from my home) and I was terrified I uninstalled the app and my car works without any problems so I wont be installing the app again its not worth an accident.	1
584	Update 10.08.20: Deleted cache and all data from Google Play Services and battery use seems to have stabilised. Like the app but have would recommend some tweaks: - Daily confirmed cases graph covers too broad a timeline. Would be better to have a week by week option to show trends. - Cases/deaths stats should show daily or weekly movement comparisons. -Total cases per county is fairly meaningless, ignores population density for one.	1
585	Very good app needed for the deconfinement, every good citizen must download this app'. Must be improved with a tdlr.	0
586	Remarkably easy to use.	0
587	Why is the app draining battery to the point where my phone is dead in 4 hours. I have uninstalled due to this....please fix	1
588	Drains my battery. Been doing so for days with no updates. Had to uninstall	1
589	App want you to leave GPS BLUETOOTH and WIFI turned on so your phone battery is useless. No point having this app. Btw I've got a Samsung S10 that last 2 to 4 whole days of use, that now runs out of battery in an hour	1
590	you sure thus app works? can't even get past the get otp page. joke on govtech	1
591	Good	0
592	Not interesting app	1
593	So easy to register if you have an IQ above 0. If +61 precedes the mobile number you drop the first 0. Great initiative brilliant idea!	0
594	The app keeps closing and won't start up. When I try to go into the app it says ehteraz keeps stopping. Close app.	2
595	App says both mine and my dad's mobile number are invalid so we can't register. Pretty stupid	2
596	Waste of money, I Think, Can you please explain how it works?	1
597	Verification code not being sent to international mobiles!?	2
598	Initially was working fine. Recently notice that it is not working when I was at crowded places like hospital, market. It show "0" exchange since recent update on new display presentation (e.g 0-5). I tried off Bluetooth than on again just capture a few . Plse look into this issue since beginning October 20. Lately it seem that it only captured maybe those arround must be longer than( number of minutes instead of of just passby). It registered lesser in number instead of in hundreds.	2

603	Had to uninstall, uses a LOT of battery and I was having to charge my phone 2 times a day ??now its uninstalled I'm getting the whole 24 hours out of a charge..	1
604	Data needs to be updated. As number of confirmed cases are there in I-10 but app isn't showing any of them City wise data should be added	2

608	Thank you for providing an application that will help many Filipinos in fighting Covid-19	0
609	Useless app. It keeps saying that the QR code can't be detected even though it works fine for my colleagues using the same code. Uninstall and reinstall countless times, now I'm stuck at the OTP portion since now the OTP can't be recognized and I can't even register.	2
610	Nice idea but drains too much battery on galaxy s20+	1
611	It does not send an OTP to my phone I tried it so many times. How can I log in wthout an OTP.	2
612	Saying my phone number is invalid, so cant get a pin	2
613	Was working great but in the last day or so it's draining my battery in a pretty major way. I didn't know what it was at first but my phone was heating up and the battery was dropping. Got a notification that it was this app. It's a great app but if it's not updated in going to need to uninstall it.	1

620	Useful app	0
621	Good	0
622	What is the duration of bluetooth proximity considered to state that the person is in contact with the infected person? Or it's just a pass on as well considers as came in to contact?	2
623	Its very helpful to know how many people that affected in covid19 and how many are death and survive or stabled	0
624	Cannot see pin number at the same time as trying to put it into varification window	2
625	The pause function is good. But only 3 choices on the duration If can improve or revamp to this part, i think the take ip rate will be even better. As majority are still encourage to Work from Home ( WFH), so the app is useful only when we step out of our home, and should be turn off when we are home. Dont your agree? So can consider having a simpler "turn on/ turn off button".. And just remind user when we go out, turn it on, just like we put on mask only when we go out of house.. Cheers	2
626	Kindly fix asap.	2
627	Keep saying validation fail.	2
628	I did a test using the generated code. The app still tell me the result are pending when I had the result 4days ago by my doctor. What's the point of the code if the result are not registered... Should have been faster by the app then a letter to my doc and me calling him. If labs don't use it, why should I bother with it and let it drain my battery? Aren't the hospital supposed to be "high risk"? 'Cause I stayed there for a full 2h and I still I'm green/low risk...	2
629	Superb app Very knowledgeable	0
630	Please make it drain LESS battery and also please make the start load screen disappear faster. When in line to scan qr codes, every second makes a difference. I'm using a high end phone but the start screen takes a while to load. when i open stock apps or other apps like youtube, whatapp etc. their load screens go away very quickly. Please fix. Otherwise i enjoy the app.	1
631	Received test result on 26th june by sms but this app still showing Your Test Result Not Available. Where to contact to resolve the issue is not available.	2
632	excellent	0
633	Nice	0
634	Good but the verification pin could have been automatically performed on Android (-1 star). Our company App puts the verification code in for you on receipt of the sms....so I would assume our government could do better. I will most probably update my review after a week.	0
635	Confusing COVID'19 / corona patient.	0
636	Good app overall, however I do not know whether it might affect my BT ear phone. It's harder to connect to my ear phones compared to before installing the app	2
637	This app is not working in android mobiles. Just download and open the application we can't do registration still application logo only can see. Please correct it fast.	2
638	Very good	0
639	This app is trash. When I scan the QR code, the app says that I cannot check in because of a connection error. Why is the government making this mandatory when I can't even use it!	2

647	Much better than previous version. Something I miss: having trend curves for each data. For example having the ICU occupancy %age is good, but having history trend curve would be much more helpful. It would allow to see if it goes up or down and at which rate.	0

655	Buggy. (Motorola G 3rd Gen Android 6) Seems to work ok for 1 - 3 hours, but time is uncertain as phone rarely leaves my pocket. Then gives error message "Unfortunately bluetooth share has stopped" Phone is then locked and must be restarted to get any functionality. Bluetooth is active on restart. No other apps using bluetooth.	1
656	Need to open the app regularly. Keeps shutting down and no notifications. Would want a force start when off function. Its probably on 30% of the time....	2
657	Cannot enter date of birth at the registration screen. Tried everyway possible in both gregorian and Hijri.	2

670	unable to scan the qr code, every time use safe entry scan, jump out the window "error scanning qr code", and ask to update the google play services, but if using other app like singpass or wechat to scan, dont have any problem, give up!	2
671	Please fix the app (add the log in thru Facebook option)... I cant log in since i created my account via website ( thru Facebook)... I tried to change password it in chrome but I cant figure it out	2
672	You need to support older devices. Tried to setup this up for my parents and in-laws... Only installed on 1 of the 4 devices. Not good enough! These are the vulnerable people.	1
673	Was working ok and then bang all of a sudden my battery drained by 80 per cent in 2 hrs. Checked my battery tool and it said that this app had been running solid for over 2 hrs and had drained the majority of my battery. Also made my phone go really hot. Uninstalled.	1

676	Excellent initiative by the Government. I want to change my mobile number to register myself. But it doesn't allow me to register myself with another mobile number. I want to delete my earlier registered number and change to a new mobile number. Thanks	0
677	Never able to activate the app, it just crashes every time	2
678	Thank	0
679	Any thoughts about adding a QR code reader to this app?	2
680	That was probably the easiest App ever to install. Remember to drop the first 0 off your mobile number. If this saves one life it is worth it! Sure it uses data but so does every App and Storecard. Let's beat this virus together Australia!	0
681	Tried many many times, but I didn't receive the OTP to my handphone to allow me activate this app at all. My HP is Huawei Android system.	2
682	Its of no use unless and untill postive patient uses it with correct information. One positive patient is living in my next building (at less than 100 m away), but Aarogya Setu didnt show any nearby postive patient.	1

684	Crash my bluetooth earphones and smartwatch after installing the app. Mobile ( Samsung Note 10) battery drains fast. My family members had the same feedback.	2

699	I was told this app would help me buy drugs and so far all I have found is undercover cross-dressing midgets and some really weird animal porn which has since caused me nightmares. Good app for those who like to be watched but not really ideal for those who have serious kinks/fetishes.	1
700	Despite having my Bluetooth on constantly, the app is telling me tracing is not active. There is clearly a bug in the app that needs fixed.	2
701	It's good for awareness.	0

743	In Iceland, this is going to be key in winding down the restrictions put in place by Covid-19 Everyone should install it, without exception. Your data is reased every 14 days and can only be accessed with your express permission.	1
744	Because I'd prefer a timely phone call if I've been exposed to Covid-19. And the app doesn't know me, my phone number, or my location. It only has a unique ID that a Health Dept staffer can use to alert me to get tested. A no brainer for everyone to install, so we can get this isolation lifted sooner!	2
745	After I make update I cannot able to open the app. Showing always update screen	2
746	Dont even think about using bluetooth devices with your phone when this app is running. I installed the app on Samsung S20. When I am using a bluetooth headset with my S20, while the app is running in the background, I will experience frequent stutters in my headset.	2

In Lahore it does not show a single pin even at Expo Center that has been converted into corona hospital.

815	The app doesn't wok. Tried to uninstall and reinstall and nothing. The app doesn't open	2
816	Triple Useless. A person with Covid-19 has to be tested positive (it's almost impossible to get tested in Japan). Then they have to use the app, register their positive status, keep their phone with them and keep the app running at all times (impractical). Finally, "contact" only counts if you're within 1 meter of such a person for at least 15 minutes at one time (an absurdly narrow definition of risk).	2

840	All data is subject to US laws under the CLOUD Act - Which allows them access to our data since it is stored on a US based companies servers (Amazon)  Would of made more sense to have this hosted securely on an Australian Network.  Deleting the app and letting everyone know.	1
841	App was fine when first released however have recently found it interferes with Fitbit linking when operating. Have to constantly disconnect app to allow other devices to sync. Not as convinced as once was that the app is worth persisting with. Waiting to see if next update addresses Bluetooth on iPhone otherwise will only turn on when I remember.	2

868	I've just downloaded the app and so far so good. All the features are very simplified to make it easy for all levels of our demographic to use it. One piece of feedback is to change the wording in the daily check in feature. You can choose one of the 2 options: "I'm good, no symptoms" and "I am not feeling well today". What if you have symptoms but are feeling ok? Ex. Having a continuous cough and some sore throat but otherwise feeling great? The app should collect more granular data.	1

878	There are huge privacy and safety concerns because app pretends to be open source and in reality is just a PWA downloaded from government's servers. Event if we compile it from source, there is no way to verify if huge part downloaded from those servers AT RUNTIME is the same as in the github repository or maliciously modified by authoritarian government.	2

885	Using this app prevents Google Play Store from downloading updates to all apps (there is bug in DownloadManager that causes app update downloads to hang at progress up to 100%). In addition, using this app stops push notifications of other apps such as WhatsApp, Gmail, MyEnv etc.... that are running in the background. I open WhatsApp to find dozens of new messages when I am running TraceTogether. This behaviour has been observed on both my husband's and my phones.	2

933	Simple unobtrusive app. If your in Ireland you should use it. One niggle and that is with the information the app displays regarding covid statistics, in common with major sites it uses 'all time' figures when really what we care about is (say) a rolling 14 day average. Can it be that currently we are running at 31% community based infections ? I really hope not.	0

1003	As mentioned in many reviews, this app has a major issue that prevents my Bluetooth headphones hold connection with my phone. I really want to install this app and help to fight the pandemic, but at the moment I had to uninstall it. Very sad, do you guys even test it? Deleting the app from my phone didn't help. But when I deleted it from my wife's phone too, everything is back to normal. Please fix that and I'll install it again.	1
1004	Light phone user, and the app drains the battery so much that it won't last the day. If your phone can't last the day with battery use, how can the app do what it's intended to do?	1

1017	Right idea, wrong execution. Violation of personal storage and phone for you to check if device is "jailbroken"? Cut the BS! No other app needs those permissions so you don't either! Drains battery very fast as constantly broadcasting gps and bluetooth. Install on an empty phone.	1
1018	You can't change app language after registration. The option is not enabled.	2
1019	The app is simple, doesn’t get in my way, shows useful information about how to use it and importantly, doesn’t show any noticeable difference to battery usage.\n\nFor all those writing on Facebook, Twitter, etc about privacy concerns, you have much better privacy with this app than the social media platforms you’re writing your concerns on.

Maybe nag after 2 days of no check-ins? Otherwise, stable and reassuring. Kudos to all involved. Pity the Google Play Services fiasco on August 8 drained batteries across the country and undoubtedly caused thousands of people to uninstall this app that required Services to run. This is life & death stuff. Take more care when testing!!	0

1099	In the Covid tracing section of the app it says to enable contact tracing you need to upgrade to the latest version of Google play services, when I click on check on upgrade it says Google exposure notifications API not available on this device yet.

I'm experiencing just one issue on the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom running ColorOS 6: although I've already given the app permission to run on background and ignore battery optimisation settings, it still shows a "x". Maybe this issue can be fixed by not trying to detect battery optimisation permissions on ColorOS because I think it's not classified as such.	1
1106	All good and then it works w/ Apple tracing too. BUT my iPhone crashed & I setup all from scratch using iCloud BUT the app doesn’t save to iCloud.

1118	This apps kills the fast charging on Samsung A70 and puts the device into a reboot loop after coming into contact with another phone with tracking apps installed. Tried to install it on a separate phone and realize that it does not support most phones. Can you compile it for older generation of Android as well?	1

1136	Awesome	0
1137	A much needed app by the Govt	0
1138	Not accurate. Map shows no pins in lahore.	1
1139	The app keeps on crashing just a moment after I open it. It made my phone overheat and it drains the battery. The worst, it's not even working and always saying "ERROR REQUESTING OTP... TRY AGAIN." And I did, more than ten times and still nothing. Pls if you're gonna require this for public use, at least fix it. We can't even go to grocery store without this!	2
1140	Most advanced solution i ever seen. Also please include MOH update every time in the app.	0
1141	Excellent program during curfew	0
1142	The app closes by itself even when I am on bluetooth. Ideally, the app should turn on the moment bluetooth comes on and it shouldn't act like an app but rather in the background. I have to use the app and it gets annoying to deal with the constant turn off.	2
1143	Downloaded the app...but don't know why my ic number is not valid....and I try passport and it didn't show Singapore	2
1144	Don't work on p40 pro.	2

1147	Works well and makes sense for everybody to have if we want to avoid lockdowns and tackle outbreaks. For those worried about being tracked , watsapp , facebook , Google all gather more information than an app that can save a life.	0

1155	Because I have the iPhone 6 it is a little slow on getting updates right away. It says I am not allowed to get the app cause my phone doesn’t have the latest update. I really want the appppppp. So now I am sad cause I can’t get the app. Idk if you can change but if you can plz do.	2

1161	What a dumb app? After updating not woking. Ask for restart always. As a mandatory app this must not like this. Please fix.	1
1162	I have been trying to download the app its not downloading why is that? Has that happen to anyone here or any advice on that?	2
1163	Unfortunately this thing drains my battery harder than any other 'passive' app out there. I can run for 16 odd hours with my usual usage on a Pixel 4 XL. With this installed (and no other new apps added) that cut down under half. Also the perpetual notification icon is incredibly annoying - it's called a notification bar for a reason, to notify, not to clog up with useless icons.	1

1174	Good idea. IU needs some polish and refinement.	0
1175	Don't exactly know if it works since I am not able to see my tracing data. Latest update gets too much personal data, why does this app need NRIC? Almost all apps have stored using nric. Also the recent update for safe entry needs more functionality to be fully effective, I am able to get my individual bar code to show a scanner at the mall, but am not able to qr scan for signs in parks, etc.	2

1191	I thought this App was supposed to tell you if people around you or close to you had symptoms, it doesn't. It gives the exact same information you can find on RTE news this app is utterly useless and a waste of tax payers money. Uninstalled.	0
1192	Great initiative. Just a note to those that don't understand how this works. This app is based on proximity. It does not track or know your location. All it knows is if you've come close to someone with COVID-19. Imagine walking blindly around town but having to raise a flag if you encounter someone wearing perfume. This is how this app works. You don't know where you are, or who is wearing the perfume, you are just made aware that you were close to someone wearing perfume.	0

Because of this problem cannot go any place.	2
1238	Does nothing	2
1239	Very laggy and drains my phone's battery extraordinarily rapidly. This insufferable app has repeatedly cut off or otherwise completely stopped music I listen to through Bluetooth. Please improve this app asap as I have to download it for school next year.	1
1240	What purpose does it serve? I assumed this was to inform close contacts of a confirmed case by bluetooth. Why had the HSE have to ask confirmed cases to personally inform their own contacts due to lack of resources? Did absolutely no-one have the app installed, or does it simply not work. Has anyone been notified of close contact through this app?	2

1243	I don't understand how such an app is made mandatory. It should be tested before being a recommendation. It drains my battery so much. I've even tested it on both android and iphone and both battery utilization is bad. The app causes lots of frustration. I rather scan my IC then use this app.	1

1262	Location cannot be turned off. Privacy-first? This is tracking garbage at its finest. Simple solution: Uninstall. You need to have location services on at any times using this "anonymous" Tracing App. Meaning you will be tracked by 3rd party anyway. There is no way turning it off which is absolutely critical for a "privacy-by-design" application. Useless ??	2

Gibraltar is a British overseas territory, as such it is relevant to the UK, you imbaciles. 2. It does tell you it is made specifically for Gibraltar, check the name of the app, you uncultured swine. 3. If you are not from Gibraltar it isn't relevant to you. This does not mean you should give it a negative review, as that does not make it a bad app.	0

1369	This app interferes with the connection of Bluetooth devices and removed some functions of my music app. I had to uninstall TraceTogether and my music app, and re-install the music app to regain the functions.

I never had any issues with my Bluetooth connections previously but there are constant breaks and jerks in the music now every few seconds, even after uninstalling this app. It broke my Galaxy S8 plus. \ud83d\ude21	2

1396	Poorly designed, badly implemented Have it on my phone just in case the so-called developers actually get it right, and it works as intended. Great idea, but .... At least can turn off Bluetooth when having the app running is useless, that is, while I am at home. We need better than a knee-jerk product to fulfill its purpose and function. Did this go through a proper design process, or was it hacked together?	0
1397	Good	0
1398	Had the app since mid July and it suddenly started draining the battery of my S20 yesterday. This seems to be happening to a lot of people all of a sudden. Needs to be fixed or everyone is going to remove the app from their phones	1
1399	So far so good. BUT, would be good to include a notification log. Plenty of users have reported notifications which can be missed and create stress and anxiety. I know that if it is a close contact the warning should be in red everything you open the app. Still the log would give reassurance. Pls consider. Phones handle messages differently. So haveing a record in the app is essential.	0
1400	After previously working ok, I started app to use it and it asked for the complex password that had been generated and previously saved. \nApp wouldn’t scan until I had asked for a reset and waited to be emailed back to generate a new one.\n10 digits plus upper & lower case plus a number ensures it’s going to be hard to remember so the phone needs to not forget it.\nAlso no way to check your own movements in case you missed one.	1
1401	Bluetooth usage kills my battery within an hour. Deleted a day after downloaded.	1
1402	Verry good	0
1403	Eats the battery and makes phone go hot, better not have damaged my new phone. All settings were turned on for contact tracing and exposure risk and didn't collate any data for 2 days. Might reinstall it if and when you produce a more viable app. Stop messing with people's safety with your inept apps!	1
1404	Nice	0
1405	Very good app	0
1406	Best app	0
1407	Doesn't work on my Huawei mate 20. Every time I open the app, the phone detects the battery drain and then shuts the app down for me to save my battery. So unless I manually reopen the app every 5-10 minutes, it's never on. So is absolutely useless.	1
1408	Updated to 1star as the need to reregister after the update is painful. Waiting for next update that has integration. I'm guessing that 99% that would download this has the SingPass app... why not enable some kind of SingleSignOn... click on link and just biometric to authenticate and get identity info? Any idea if this enhancement is in flight?	2
1409	Radius alert is not accurate	2
1410	The apps keep stopping when i just started to open it	2

1412	Good for anticipation	0
1413	Why has the Covid app. Changed, I used to be able to keep updated on Queensland cases, now I only get an over view of all cases! Which means I am unable to check to see if there are any new cases in Qld. Not Happy!	1
1414	TraceTogether definitely has a faster reaction time when scanning the QR code. Using it has been fuss free and the favourite tab is extremely conveniently for highly frequent places. It would be great if we are also able to find the list of places near us (similar to Singpass app) for check in so that we are not dependent on finding and scanning the QR code.	0
1415	great idea. All the best	0
1416	Good	0
1417	Glad that new update allows to pause the app. Hope it could pause for longer time, since staying at home most of the time, else the battery drains fast.	2

1438	Very informative and reassuring.	0
1439	It definitely interferes with other Bluetooth devices, listening to music on Bluetooth earbuds sounds like a broken recorder everytime someone with tracetogether walks past. Especially on the train when there are many people, its frustrating... :(	2
1440	Flattens my battery. Useless	1
1441	Hi i have colleague using the app on Samsung A70, however after upgrading since version 2.3.7, the app cannot detect any exchanges (shown 0 exchanges). Edit-Update: After updating version 2.3.10, problem resolved.	2
1442	Battery juice quite fast out... If turn off location the battery quite last	1
1443	I can't even download! Poor	2
1444	Easy to install and use. Drains battery but small price to pay for safety. Suggest the developers consider a safe zone so that the app isn't working as hard when you're at home.	0
1445	Verry good	0
1446	This app is annoying. Yes ive downloaded it and let it take control of my settings. Unfortunately it wants control of battery optimization. I allowed as its the only way it will turn on but it constantly turns off all day and i have to reset the battery optimization again even with a full battery it does this. Whats the point of it if it keeps turning off	1
1447	Most of the time the app shows blank and then QR code needs to be done. After uninstalling to reinstall the download keeps on saying pending. Worst app.	1
1448	Very good for security and safe from carona	0
1449	Very nice	0
1450	Phone number registration is active and working now (6pm Sunday). I don't like that it needs Location permission for it to be active and works properly (though GPS location is not required to be turned on) Update: 01/11 uninstalled the app because it now needs GPS turned on to be active now 19/12 reinstalled due to flare up in Northern beaches, but I will not turn on GPS	2
1451	crahes a lot	2
1452	Drains the battery. Shows 200 BT hits even tho i stayed at home the whole day	1
1453	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

1462	Very bad. It disappears suddenly and until now always showing question mark thus I cannot go inside shops to buy important food stuffs	1
1463	This new update won't download - rendering the app useless.	2
1464	The app should be installed to at least 80-90% of the population to be effective. A better publicity campaign and easier to understand privacy explanations might be helpful.	0
1465	Unable to be installed on my phone. Other than Apple and Google services, can include the app into Huawei Mobile Services too? I have asked several times on this issue already.	2

1480	This app is not compatible with with Oppo phones for the battery optimisation requirement. The app will turn off after 10min and requires credentials to be reset every 10min.	1
1481	Downloaded app. In two minutes the OTP expires and does not allow end user to reinstall app. 2nd time no OTP number given for verification. Same with mother's and sister's phone. 1st time entering pin no. it says incorrect. Which is odd given we had quickly written the 6 digit numbers needed. While app is to assist in tracing, to upload is user unfriendly	2

1487	Over All good app. Updates are informative & multiple options. All updates are according to Govt of Pakistan's official COVID-19 status. On technical basis this app consumes/drains more device resources & memory, which is very strange thing to notice. Perhaps devs solve this issue in time.	0

1498	The app continuously becomes inactive in the background without any notification to fix it. It appears this has something to do with the battery optimisation settings, which switches off when I exit the app. The app also seems to be killing my battery despite the fact the app being inactive 99% of the time. Meaning this app cannot collect any data to stop the spread of covid-19. This app is a good idea but the execution is terrible and extremely buggy. I have uninstalled until it's fixed.	1

1511	After using for a week and experiencing significant battery drain I have chosen to remove the app. After being fully charged at 7am using my phone for 24min (on screen time) the COVID-19 tracker accounted for 63% of my phones battery usage over a 5 hours, leaving me at 50%.\n\nThe app is a wonderful concept but I am not willing to put up with the effects on my battery life while waiting for mass adoption.	1
1512	Found be developed more	0
1513	Pretty useless if you think about it. The app asks the user if he's okay and shows the same on the dashboard. Doesn't make sense to use that status as verification for any purpose. I don't understand how airports, hotels etc. are still using this.	1

Thanks in advance P.s. just fixed the problem by clearing data and cashe and reentering all my personal information again as if I am registering for the first time .	2
1535	I own a s10 plus and the app works fine. However, when playing audio from my Bluetooth ear buds, it seems like the app interferes when searching.

1540	I never got any alerts from this application even though I had covid affected neighbours. The worst thing is that I got COVID-19 infection and the application shows that Im safe. I guess this application is just for data collection and there is no other motive of this application.	1
1541	Not at all reliable have stopped working for past few days after android update..don't know when the bug will be fixed by Ehteraz team..hope they understand the importance of this app to be functional to access work place and supermarkets.. pls do something asap as we cannot wait for your new releases and live without going for work or groceries... when is the 8.04 release as this issue has typically put us under lockdown everytime this stops it's not feasible to buy new phones...	2

So after trying to download it again and the problems continued, I chose to not keep the app because it's not worth the battery consumption as the app isn't even working.	0

1668	So far APP still okay the only down thibg is SingPass APP can auto detect and list down the nearby location plus filtering distance but this APP cant. If this function is implement will be good as it will speed up the check-in instead of one by one scan QR Code.	0
1669	Great idea. It will filter out those that have come close to someone who later has been tested and found to have COVID19 and so these people will be notified as opposed to those who haven't been anywhere near someone who was later tested and found to have COVID19.	0
1670	There was a previous complaint which was fixed very efficiently. Good response timing. Updated the rating.	0
1671	Wonderfull app i like this app	0
1672	Tried to sign up but keeps telling me wrong number? And will not give me a p in ?	2
1673	Nice	0
1674	Very good Ehteraz	0
1675	The app continually crashes. Looking through the reviews it is very difficult to understand how this app has a score of 4.5 when there are page after page of people who can't get it to work!!!	2
1676	app doesn't work. "no data detection" since installation despite internet connection	1
1677	Good	0
1678	Just look at the negative feedback re battery drain, login issues etc. And the government insists that 70% of the population uses this highly flawed app or the equally problematic token before moving on Phase 3. What a joke.	1
1679	Keeps telling me that my number is invalid	2
1680	Very good	0
1681	Got as far as entering my name and postcode, but repeatedly received the error message "invalid phone number" when I tried to enter it. It's definitely my phone number but until the app recognises it I can't begin using it. Unhelpful.	2
1682	Way may ehteraz now didn't responding dis bad for me because when I go to department store to buy the daily needs he didn't not go inside because my ehteraz didn't not responding	2
1683	Waited 2 hours to receive pin code. Got tired of waiting and Uninstaller app.	2

1692	good	0
1693	fun app to use! so far i have come into contact with my family members, also have to keep my phone charged the entire day because this app requires bluetooth, location, nfc, wifi, mobile data, flashlight, blue light filter, mobile hotspot, always on display, night mode, edge lighting and sync to be constantly on! Whenever i unplug from the charger, my phone dies within 5 hours. Would totally recommend this app to anyone willing to make your battery run out!\ud83d\udd0b0\ufe0f\u20e3	1
1694	The app is nice bt after some few days it's stopped working why	2
1695	Drian battery	1
1696	Initially didn't recognise my phone number, 5 attempts later accepted it. It then took 9 PIN requests because it never sent the PIN before the 5 minute time out.	1
1697	Am running new phone Android 10. No matter how many times I give it full permission, it says it is not authorised. Effectively, it doesn't work.	2
1698	A very good app .time to time updation will be more good .i always on it when i go to store or for anything so that i will know the places ..if that place was visited before by a possitive case or any of its contact..thank u so much ..great work .	0

1702	Useless application.	1
1703	Complete waste of tax payer money. Typical liberal government paying liberal party donors money for worthless trash. Think this was written by someone in first year of computing at Tafe. Hasn't traced one case.	1
1704	It seems fine like other corona apps but I keep getting these error messages: Cause 4000: Something went wrong. Error during web request.	0

1710	No use for a visit visa holder....	2
1711	This app doesn't work for an inch!!! Followed all instructions as displayed. Still 'safe and green' while I have been in bed with fever and tested positif for Covid for 2 days!	2
1712	Couldn't manage to download on multiple attempts. Once it downloaded asking for version update, but jumping back to play store after pushing version update button. Thanks for the fast reply, doesn't give option to update, trying reinstalling it, but again doesn't download.	2

1720	Have to keep allowing battery optimisation to be ignored. I doubt it's working a lot of the time because of this. Needs a fix for this!	1
1721	Right after I completed an update it seems to affect the app unable to function. It just pops up then I get back to my homescreen.	2
1722	Can't download it	2
1723	Works well but takes up to much battery power.	1
1724	I think this app is a good thing. I hope everyone downloads it, not only for their own safety but for the safety of their friends, their loved ones and their country.p	0
1725	Good aplication	0
1726	very bad... tried creating an account using my ic but it says that 15 year olds can't have an ic and that i can only register when i'm 17 years old but yet the givernment asked me to register and get an ic. when i tried creating with a student pass i can't cause im not a foreigner? so how exactly am i supposed to make an account to use my token?	2
1727	Auto close	2

1730	This software stopped snowing not working my device kindly advice	1
1731	When ever i install and open the App it's showing error. Only 1s I can the in 1 week. Requesting for help. As I needed in various places for entry	2
1732	why it's not working.....	2
1733	Appalled by the uselessness and the people leading our covid effort. I am deleting the app today and wish we can delete the politicians that got us all into this mess with their indecisiveness and lack of leadership	1
1734	Ever since the Bluetooth update, scanning of QR codes has slowed down dramatically. It used to be a split second to scan a QR code, whereas now it takes 2-4 seconds.	1
1735	Such a noble initiative in this moment of severe crisis.i don't actually know its outcome yet but if it works,then it would be kind of a blessing to keep anyone distant from a covid patient and tracing an one as well!But before that you need to reach this info with wide no. Of people and make ensure of its using.	0
1736	I keep trying but can't even download it.	2
1737	Trash	1
1738	superb.	0
1739	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0
1740	Installed ok. However, my Bluetooth suddenly became inoperative and I wasn't able to turn it on again. Beware of this App.	0
1741	I have been trying to put in all my details properly yet it says validation fail. I don't understand why it shows that my name and my IC no is wrong. I did it many time and yet cannot go through as all my details are correct. Another thing is even when I put my OTP correctly it says it is wrong.This app has some issues they need to rectify soon. Really annoying. I am uninstalling it.	2
1742	Simple and easy to use, all the information i need in one app.	0
1743	Damn this app is power hunger-it smashes the battery like V6 engine	1

1751	Totally draining battery since 08/08/20.	1
1752	Even after 14 hours of landing I have not received any notification and request for selfie. Even I try to reach call centre of shlonik, nobody is picking up call.	2
1753	Using the app since the launch and I'm happy. It achieves what it promises: efficient and transparent covid-19 contact tracing in this new normal. I found the app to have a clean and neat design and it runs smoothly in the background. No noticeable battery loss on my 2+ year old Sony xperia series phone. (Tip: If you are too worried about the battery, which given the situation is a minor inconvenience at most, maybe consider switching off the bluetooth and location when you are inside your home for long durations).	0
1754	Excellent and very useful	0
1755	Worked first time as advertised . Ignore all the idiots that tried to register before registration was open.	0
1756	One of the recent updates lead to a pop-up about an improvement in location services to be shown _every_ time I enable or disable GPS on my phone. This drives me nuts! I had to force stop the application to avoid the pop-ups. I shall wait for an update with fix and if not published promptly - uninstall the application.	1
1757	Very good help	0
1758	It sucks. I won't even touch it if I wasn't forced to download it.	1
1759	today morning my application not starting. I reinstalled application. unable to get OTP.	2
1760	Battery drains really quickly. I have read that this is being rectified? When? If not soon, I will have to delete, which I don't really want to do.	1
1761	How can you rate this app it is not accepting phone numbers. And wont allow you to register. Iam the 3rd person in our group to try. Monday 27 04 2020 .	2
1762	I don't know. Registration issue. Can't connect OTP at all. That's bad	2
1763	It won't valid my number and my mum can't even download it. Very disappointed I hope this app gets a lot better.	2
1764	Not working, I can't register and I received message "there is something went wrong" every time I tried to sign up	2
1765	Not too sure where to ask question. May i check, since the bluetooth are always on, will this compromise our handphone contents? As in, just like wifi, bad people can access your handphone data without you knowing... Thanks	2

1770	To the developers, initially covid status is green when i install the app, though i haven't undergone any test, it still showing green, its misguiding, so it'll be better if you can add new status showing "Not tested". Thanks	2

1776	This app ran reasonable well in the previous iteration, but the latest update (which now requires location to be on where it didn't previously) is a massive drain on the battery - to the point where I'm charging continuously throughout the day when I have the opportunity.	1

1790	Chews up all the battery in my phone would b better if my battery doesn't run out while i am out because the app would b useless without the phone.	1
1791	Unreliable, untrustable, too slow	1
1792	Waste of space. Kills battery and requires so much information that invades user's privacy.	1
1793	Great idea, and user friendly app. Gives tops results for the situation at hand in ireland. Sadly I had to uninstall as it was draining my battery and my phone was excessively overheating. Could do with tweaking something to reduce this from happening.	0
1794	Tedious waste of time, why not use the already present qr code scan or ID card instead of this useless app. I want to remain private and that choice should be respected not forced upon by a bunch of fools who don't have an ID scanner	2
1795	Utter battery hog, won't run properly with battery optomisation or battery saver on and keeps interfering with other bluetooth devices like my headphones, has been since day 1 and the issue still hasn't been fixed.	1
1796	find it diffucult to download	2

1810	I think location id should be useful to trace where covid19 contact incurred. I personally do want to know that info to help me trace the "crowd" I was with!	0
1811	App tells you what to do next if you’ve been exposed, but only if you then get a positive test. I have tested negative after getting an alert but the app seems to be on the alert screen indefinitely. Feels a little “boy who cried wolf” or ineffective when considering I likely risk exposure more than once through the duration of the pandemic. Poorly thought out or not clearly marked if this “reset” feature does already exist.	1
1812	Easy as...took no time at all. Please everyone do this for the sake of you and the people you love and for everyone who lives in this wonderful country. We all want to be able to hug our parents, siblings, nieces, nephews. If you are worried about your info being out there you should get rid of all the social media you have.... seriously.	0

1822	Hey Govtech Team, my app is stuck at the page where I have to enter my phone number to receive an OTP. Entered my phone number and clicked Get OTP and the loading button appears for a moment but nothing happens after that. Reinstalled the app and problem persists. Please fix.	2
1823	Once running, seems to be very good. But was hard to find. Wasn't immediately clear if there was a background daemon service running or the app had to be "minimized" but not closed to work. Samsung Galaxy 8 running Android 9: It seems Samsung's battery optimisation service was killing the app. After a reboot, it seemed OK, though. Closing/swiping away the app and then toggling bluetooth on/off showed it was still running (I got an alert from the app saying bluetooth needs enabled).	0
1824	After last update it is closing immidiately when start to work , make sure it has not any bug before launch , my phone is mi 8 lite	2
1825	Total lack of information. Nobody seems to be running this useless app. Absolute disgrace for the minister in charge of it. Never heard a word from him. No idea if it is used at all or just switched off. A major deceit on the Australian public. Lukily the States are manually doing what this National app was supposed to do.	2

1832	Installed no problem on S9, but I have a smart watch BT for tracking 24/7 in case of seizure when away from home & BT headset to make/receive calls, App disconnects headset or watch to handshake other phones all the time. Had to uninstall it.	0

1835	Had been working fine until recently, then my phone battery which would normally last for almost 2 days on one charge was drained in a matter of minutes even when not in use. I did not want to delete it but the apps not going to work if your phone is dead! This needs to be fixed ASAP and assured it won't happen again before ppl can even consider redownloading!	1
1836	On several occasions, when I want to leave my workplace late in the evening after spending about 12 hours there, the last check-in is no longer showing on my home screen, so I was unable to do a check-out. Is there a flaw?	2
1837	Great app \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d	0
1838	Apps does not work on my brand new Oppo Reno 2 because my phone has auto lock security which cannot be turned off which mean apps turn off as soon as my screen locks which makes app the useless that my reason for uninstalling!	1

1843	This is not a bad review for the sake of it, here are things to change 1. Share this app button, who uses that? Swap it out to either show the places you are checked in, or press it to access the favourites 2. Why do I need to activate the camera for scanning, then be able to press favourites, that should already be in the main menu, thus two \u53cd\u4eba\u7c7bdesign choices make this app more cumbersome to use than what It could have been	2
1844	Excellent \ud83d\ude02	0
1845	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
1846	Disrupts my Bluetooth ear piece intermittently	2
1847	The application would close on its own. I once tried to keep this app open and not switch to anything else and once my mobile go into standby mode, it's closed and I have to relaunch again. Edit: Thx 4 reply. Oppo user > Battery >Energy Saver> Trace> Disable Background Freeze, Abnormal Apps Optimisation, Doze. Hope this helps and maybe update the app for the front page so users will instantly know what to look for in their mobile? I didn't know until I start digging around my settings.	2
1848	Great app!	0
1849	Love the app! Can you not integrate it with restaurants so that we don't have to write our info at each place if we have the app?	0
1850	An independent review has found that the privacy risks associated with the app have been addressed and that it is likely to help reduce the spread of the virus.  Sharing tokens/beacons with other devices that can later be linked back together as a chain is the best way to track contact and respect privacy.	0

1859	Good app - nice design, loads quickly and I couldn’t find any bugs \n\nSome minor issues/suggestions: it would be nice if it integrated with password managers and also if you could verify via phone rather than email. It might also be nice to have the option to not delete everything after 30 days. And if you could make the code open source that would be awesome	0

1876	I am a covid positive patient the phone number I gave while getting tested is the same number that I have used to log in. But still the app says "you're safe". How will anyone on Earth around me will know that I'm positive. Even though I'm being responsible and staying inside.	0
1877	So far so good. I will get tested in due time and will upload my result to the app, so that it can do it's job by upping the game on contact tracing.	0

1886	The app was running good before this but after few update seem having with the contact tracing. The number interected with other phone through Bluetooth showing zero always and battery consumption shoot up. I tried to uninstall and install back but now that also problem because it stop at OTP number and I never get the OTP also. My HP model is HONOR View 20.	2
1887	Wow! This is wonderful app	0
1888	The app should be installed to at least 80-90% of the population to be effective. A better publicity campaign and easier to understand privacy explanations might be helpful.	0
1889	It does nothing, a complete waste of taxpayer money. This app deviates from standard APIs and uses its own which do not work. Other than the obvious privacy issues the app has failed on its main objective of contact tracing and is useless	1
1890	Nice	0
1891	Works well but completely destroys battery life. Battery was terrible while I had it then I uninstalled it for a day to see if the app was the problem, battery was far better without.	2
1892	As much as i want to help by using this app, the app simply fails to do its function, as far as in my case. the scan feature just scans and scans and scans and does not actually load any output, the notifications are also quite annoying, and when i turned on the location it malfunctioned and showed the not responding alert	2
1893	Worst app of the world	1
1894	Great idea, would be great if it didn't ruin your phone. It made my phone much slower and made my music cut out constantly when using Bluetooth. It took me a while to figure out what caused it, then as soon as I uninstalled the app the issue was solved.	0

1901	Big ? Is showing no update or registration kindly help	1
1902	Why i cant download :((	2
1903	App was simple to install...maybe 2 mins, and is an important tool to protect society. Not sure why so many people are having trouble with their phone numbers...possibly forgetting to drop the zero from the front. Also, people complaining about gps/location being needed don't seem to understand how the app works. If you use Google or Facebook, your having much more data collected than this app!	0
1904	I never have my Bluetooth turned on all day cause it drains the battery and is a source for intrusive spyware. This app is useless and will not protect you from the virus as has been witnessed in Singapore, but it's an invaluable tool for the police to watch your every move and maybe even fine you if you breach social distancing rules. The age of tyranny and persecution is amongst us thanks to this virus that was created in a lab.	1
1905	One bug I found on my Galaxy Note 9, it trys to put background apps to sleep including this tracker. I had to manually disable the app from sleeping.	2

1915	Great. But please implement search to to check-in feature that SingPass has. Thanks!	0
1916	Interface mostly available in English (although the amount of contents in English seems to shrink with each update), with clear explanations on how the app works, privacy protection, etc and I didn't notice much battery drain.	0
1917	Nice pic	0
1918	I went to the effort of downloading the app, ended up with the virus and nobody I spoke with at DHHS had anything to do with the team that wants to upload the data... so all my possibly useful data was lost as 21 days passed.	1
1919	I dont know why it asking updates two days once, does it happens only to me?..	2
1920	This app shows a totally misleading and inaccurate results vis a vis the radius alert. As far as the the data regarding infected cases is concerned, you can get the same from other reliable resources as well. Further, it keeps on crashing and fails to start. So there is no use of this app and doesn't serve the purpose it was intended for. Therefore, uninstalling it.	2
1921	App gives me no tech grief so I'm happy.	0
1922	I think this app is worth supporting and give it 5 stars for attempting to break new ground and help reduce the spread of C19.	0

1930	Super app	0
1931	I using Samsung note 20 ultra n is not constantly working fine. Maybe is OS issue.	2
1932	Why is this APP asking for access to the pictures, media and phone calls? Just the location access should be good enough for making the APP functional. Pictures and media are private of each individual and his or her family members and respecting this privacy is very important.	1
1933	It surely helps keeping you updated with areas affected by covid19. I am proud to be a part of a community-driven solution in fighting the pandemic. Bayanihan!	0
1934	Worst app, use more data than games. Use less than 30min ady 0.97gb. Keep running in the background, 1 hr drop 15% battery. IT need to do something to improve better user experience.	1

1985	Helpful app	0

1987	Excellent method of tracking	0
1988	V nice app	0
1989	This app is not much use to me until they bring out an English language version. I find it impossible to get it to work.	1
1990	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0
1991	Seems to be working just fine, but I wish it would automatically turn on when I started the phone.	1
1992	I’m not able to find the form the arrivals are supposed to fill before boarding the flight to Kuwait …	2

2004	Phone number wouldnt load for a while	2
2005	A great concept but it needs all of us to use it to help keep us all safe. Note oppo users will need to lock the app so the phone doesn't close it down. To do that, start the app, tap the square menu thing at the bottom of your phone, swipe the app down (you should then see a padlock at the top left of the app screen).	0
2006	Downloaded app a few weeks ago due to work requirement. All was ok though app uses battery ALOt. 2 day ago the app got updated, since then im not able to validate my personal details..

2019	Installed the app but discovered location permission is required. This is a google/android requirement not govt requirement. I trust the OZ govt but I don't trust google or android. App will be uninstalled. Shame because the govt initiative is good.	2
2020	COVID SAFE APP PROBLEM My partner cannot download the covid safe app as he has an overseas google account and when he tries to download it the response is "this item is not available in your country". He has an Australian sim card in his phone and is in Australia indefinitely. Google only allow you to change your google account country once every 12 months. The app developer needs to enable the app download for those people who have google accounts registered in another country - as it would	1

2037	Nothing wrong with oppo phones. Your oppo is protecting your information and phone processes. This app is invasive and shouldn't rely on 24/7 access. Taking the QR code photo should be suffice. Seems like the government doesn't trust us to do the right thing.	2

2086	It's written it needs Bluetooth ON all the time, Ok for that, it's the way it works. But it also requests GPS autorisation to be ON all the time, leaving other apps to potentially drain battery! Disappointed that the government together with our polytechnic schools weren't able to make something clean. Only reason to accept it is for protecting society.	1
2087	Any previous issues with battery drain have been fixed now completely, no problems with it	1
2088	Same bug with this new version as the bug on the older version that deactivate the app systematically. Why create a new version if you don't fix previous bugs?! I'm uninstalling it.	1

2206	Worst appðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ 	1
2207	I've uninstalled the Covid tracker - it's on my business phone, which is where I need it and i lost business when phone power completely drained & phone automatically switched off.	1
2208	I have no confidence that this app is even working, the only thing I have noticed is the obstrusive notification bar and the drain on my battery. Here is an idea, have a count that gets updated when you connect with someone. That would help increase my confidence. Additionally, have an option to enable automatically only when away from home, or leaving a specific WiFi network.	1
2209	Not sure how this work. But good initiative.	0
2210	Amazing	0
2211	It's good I'm pretty happy with it so far my only recommendation is to see a breakdown of active cases per county	0

2217	Best app to know about covid situation in Pakistan	0
2218	Finally working with contract tracing API.	0
2219	Okay. On the phone to MANY dead ends. People putting the phone down on me. Eventually, Western Cape Department of Health call center person said to me that the App doesn’t work. \nI strongly suggested that they remove the app from the App Store and PUBLICISE the fact that it is not working. I said that by giving a false sense of security regarding exposures far more dangerous to his situation than not having an App.	2
2220	Very important app safe life thanks	0

2223	Battery drain, unable to use or to update. I social distance all the time. Have mixed view on app, good idea to quell fear in anxious or medically challenged individuals, but not everyone in society has access to this kind of technology, so other methods of semi controlling this virus are more effective. As, regards privacy, I have many concerns, with data harvesting. No, app is a 100pc safe, but, I truly suspect that many will, not use this, due to an invasion of Civil Liberties and non clarity	1
2224	I had to uninstall. This app was draining my mobile's battery in less than 8 hours. Also the data provided is not useful in telling how the app is helping us to prevent new cases. i. e. . How many people has been advised to isolate because close contact was detected. Irish Tax money was used for this app. I am disappointed.	1
2225	Very useful and am getting proper notifications on time...thank you	0
2226	Not sure it is working properly. Everytime I decide to check in on the app, it says battery optimiser is on and it's not working. I then put this on but it goes back to off again. Also there is no way in settings to make sure this app doesn't get this treatment. Ahh!!	1

2241	This app and google play services in the last few days have been draining the battery in my wife's phone. Not happening on my phone, although were both have the same model.	1
2242	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
2243	cant register.. after click accept t&c network error pop out.. dont have problem with my network..	2
2244	not receiving otp at all	2
2245	Battery drain, I've followed steps uninstall, Google play-deleting cache and re installing but if it continues I'll be deleting as not much point in having it if my phones dead all the time	1
2246	This app keeps telling me that i provided a wrong data..when i already provided my mobile number correctly... Even after all the complains here on the review section...the developer seems to never care at all.	1

2254	Nicely done, but extremely difficult to use as a foreigner who does not speak bahasa. Creating an english friendly option would be easy and safe everyone's time.	0
2255	Seems fine and not much battery drain. However, can't say if it works and if it's efficient since too few people have installed the app. Welcome to the new era where Emocracy rhymes with Trumpidity of the mass.	0

2257	This app sucks my battery life. Need to keep manually disabling it when it's not required. Good thing there's the token.	1

2261	Cannot update particulars despite multiple attempts, kindly address	2
2262	It interferes with all my bluetooth devices. Cannot listen to songs nor watch videos. It will cause my videos and songs to stop abruptly for 30s to a min. But once uninstalled, my songs and videos plays normally.	2
2263	I tried to install doesnt work for andriod 7.0 devices. Shows error when i try to run for my collegues	2
2264	Sometimes the App hangs and ask me to scan again, retrr, and it's slow to respond	2
2265	Good idea if this works and being notified if you have been possibly exposed to get checked and self isolate to help stop the spread.	0
2266	Cannot be downloaded...always pending	1
2267	A must-have app these days. I don't understand why people complain about the required location access (it didn't even come up on my phone) when they are so willing to share every detail with Google, Apple, Facebook, etc., but then throwing big complaints for such an app. What a hypocrisy.	0
2268	Constantly disrupting my bluetooth connections for other devices, would suggest that the scanning priority to somehow be adjusted to not interrupt other connections	2
2269	app should helpful, if ppl add this	0
2270	After installation, I could not play video/youtube. After uninstalling, video/youtube get back to normal. Please help to resolve the bug. I am using Note 9	2

2272	Notification bar for other apps cut off after latest update. Was ready to do a complete reset on my phone because of this. I have already reset all my apps and have been spending the last 3 days re configuring all the preferences so I'm pissed off. Couldn't find anything on Google to explain why this was happening then had a revelation that it might be this app causing all my headaches and lo and behold I deleted the app and I have my phone back! Now I just have to get all my apps back in order	1
2273	This app has caused unusual behavior to my Oppo Reno 12. The Notification sound activated very frequently and the icons shown top of my phone blinks even after Bluetooth was turned off. After running scan via Phone Manager app, then only my phone back as normal. Please check the app compatibility.	2

2286	Works well, not intrusive, updates automatically. Does what it's supposed to do. Plus, a nice place to see simple relevant statistics on Covid in Belgium	0
2287	Could do with a reminder to check in each day and maybe more up to date stats on the counties but overall a great way of tracking Covid. More people just need to start using it regularly	1

2299	It won't let me register. Keeps telling me my phone number isnt valid. We have checked several times and all fields are filled with no. in 10 digit form.	1
2300	Easy to use, your data/privacy is protected and it can safe us from a second wave. Perfect app!	0
2301	The app keeps on closing. I can't even open it. I just downloaded the app and keeps on closing. Also it is not avaiblable to be downloaded for ios 12 or below.	2
2302	Very simple to install. Just remember NOT to use the starting 0 when you enter your phone number because of the +61 format in the registration process and finally make sure you have Bluetooth ON so it keeps running in the background.	0
2303	I cant use it.	2
2304	Y i cant get the OTP?	2
2305	The SafeEntry Check-In tab which you have added, it would be good if you also add a QR Code Scan function so that we do not have to use another App to scan.	2

2310	This software does not seem to require us to use it, it keeps Bluetooth on all the time, causing damage to mobile	1

2338	With the covid-safe installed there are constant interuptions to other devices also using Bluetooth. Uninstall covid-safe no problems. Would love to use this app but it is very hard to listen to interrupted music	1
2339	I can't register. It keeps saying that there is something wrong with the connection even though our internet connection is good.	2
2340	Good	0
2341	App will have an error during registration process when you submit your mobile phone and you used an alias name with a number in it. The error message will say \u201cError verifying phone number\u201d which is not a helpful error message. To fix this, simply change your alias name and remove the numbers or possibly any other special characters in it.	2
2342	No issues on Sony Xperia XZ or IPhone.	0
2343	I don't think mine is working at all. I activated all settings, but it goes by itself to exposure logging stop. I wonder what is the use that case, if I don't even know if that was on or not.	2

2357	No updated translation for the English version...	2
2358	App is good! Maybe you could send a push notification if someone swipes up to close the TT app, as some of us might actually do that, and forget to let it run in the background sometimes. Other than that, it’s easy to use!	0
2359	Deleted as now requires location to be on. Used to work with Bluetooth only, but can't have location on constantly. Will download again if they fix	1
2360	I like the incorporation of barcode with QR scanner, plus allowing to click check out when done. Suggestion to have function of frequently used places so we can save a couple of places/QR codes that we often visit (e.g. workplace, nearby minimart) to minimize the 'crowding' of people scanning QR codes.	2
2361	Battery drain for Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S9 on most recent updates. I almost bought a new phone until I saw the posts on boards.ie. it could be a Google play issue or covid app issue.	1
2362	Very secure and private system	0
2363	Don't download!! This is a government attempt at spying on Australian citizens phone data by creating a backdoor.	1

2367	Hi developers. You have made a serious oversight. Service personnel with 11B do not know our date of issue, and it's not stated on the 11B itself. The app can no longer be used.	2
2368	When I finished downloading this app can't install this app what happen??	2
2369	Very good & very helpfull but need update everyday	0
2370	Good	0

2407	Works well if not informatively, but had to uninstall when it rendered my Android Phone unusable with unbelievable battery consumption. Worse still did not show in statistics as using the power, thereby rendering phone unusable. Regrettably had to uninstall. Put it back when it was fixed and it was great for a while, them had another huge increase in battery consumption. I mistakenly blamed this app, as a logical move, but am upgrading rating as I was wrong and it was not the cause of my issue	0
2408	It is not good at regarding to network and this notification always on control panel saying restart your phone. even if you do can't disappear. Now have two new tests but not updated as before. yet using same medical unit.	1

2415	Overheats my phone and rapidly drains my battery. I had to uninstall.	1
2416	sorry to say but it\u00b4s Useless app ???	1
2417	After multiple media sources had said these track and trace apps are being shared with the police I uninstalled. My understanding was that my details would be encrypted and I was basically known as a number/key and my details WOULD NOT be shared with ANYONE. I guess its just another way for the government to spy on you and fine you. NO THANKS.	2
2418	I think it's a good idea if it reduces the spread of the various anything to keep my nearest and dearest safe hse are doing a great job and everbody that works with In the system	0
2419	Recently the app is very large and it takes awhile for the app to open the scan qr code page.	2
2420	Good app, I would suggest to ask everyday if you have symptoms, and the app just ask every 30days, if I'm not wrong. Anyway, remind everyday is a suggestion cause I always forget to check in	0
2421	This app posted to my Facebook page without my permission.	2

2424	The app was simple to register for and will provide an enormous benefit for the community. Naysayers will try to derail this but ultimately it is for the common good. Not a fan of the continuing notification bar - or at least the 'keeping you safe' part. Because the app doesn't keep the user themselves safe. It keeps the community and later potential contacts safe.	0

2456	Easy download, no account needed and no intrusive questions.  But I wonder if you close the app if it still runs in the background.	0
2457	Had no problem with the app from day one. It will only be functional if everyone downloads it. Example, if just one person downloaded it how can it ping on anyone else's phone.	0
2458	Works fine. No issues here	0
2459	Can the developers come up with a solution to prevent the app from distrupting bluetooth devices connected to the phone?	2

2464	Today when I tried to open to show at almeerah, it was not opening. Seems some kind of glitch. Even I restarted my mobile several times. Am now uninstalling and reinstalling to see.

2472	The data provided within the app isn't necessarily useful. There is a county by county breakdown, showing *total* number *since the beginning* of the pandemic. At this point these numbers provide no useful information, instead 14 day averages or five day averages, per 100K population should be shown, as these would give residents an indication of how their area is faring. In addition, the breakdown could be done on a council basis.	1

2479	Poor, having major issues downloading the app. Have restarted, phone cleared Google play & service data, cache etc, etc. Phone software updated. App finally installed, now has message saying connection issue! Yet I'm able to access the play store, email, social media etc.	1
2480	Kudos to the GovTech team for this, fuss free and not complicated to set up!	0
2481	It's just information, not the actual tracker. But has plenty of information that's 100% accurate.	0
2482	Each day I have more than 300 exchanges with TT users. Not possible. I am staying at home and my TT shows 74 exchanges.	1
2483	This is very sadly premitive app not Many options or benefits, i find it useless specially it is in Turkish only	1
2484	Easy to use and hope more people download it so that we can all help fight this disease. I wish there was more detail about where the outbreaks occur. Specific towns or villages, rather than regional, hence the 4 star rating, rather than 5	0
2485	This is a great idea to trace out contacts. But it probably work ,when maximum parentage of the population were checked out their RT-PCR and when the greater number ( seems 95%) of the population using an android device. Otherwise it can't helpful.	0

2493	This should be given a negative star. The first day after installation, it drained my phone battery from full charge to less than 10 percent overnight when I slept, note that it wasn't even launched and actively running. I have uninstalled it, despite being forced to download it in the first place.	1
2494	Doing what it says on the box. I'm happy to try and get on to of COVID-19 by using this app.	2
2495	It says wrong credentials it says my number is not register how can i fix it and also have other number i have no idea whose number is this	1
2496	Good experience	0
2497	Necessary app. Hope it gets the uptake to make it useful. In terms of constructive feedback. Encountered an issue where bluetooth audio stutters (spotify on huwawei p20 pro)while contact tracing is active.	0

2508	I come in contact with multiple people throughout the day for work still from a safe distance and it will give me some peace of mind to know if I’ve been around someone who may have exposed me . I did have a question for the developer though - does the app need to be open for it to be sharing the Bluetooth codes ? Or will it run in the background while closed ? Thanks !	0
2509	Bakwas . Kisi kaam ki nhi hai ye app.	1

2515	This latest version is definitely a much improved version. The downside is still the drain on the battery life. Also is there any plan to incorporate the scanning of QR code? It's nice to have the barcode for scanning but scanning of QR code can be much easier and faster instead.	2
2516	Effective, KPI informations, an interesting bundle of useful information	0
2517	Eating up my batteries, need to charge constantly.	1
2518	I wish everyone in Switzerland would install this. As for UX, the English messages could be improved - I sent an email. (Bluetooth must remain on in order to track encounters. Turning on airplane mode? Follow-up by turning on bluetooth. Battery Saver mode also hinders the app.)	0

2531	I have tried several times to install the app without success! I am 77 years old with very poor computer/phone skills & U have NOT made it obvious or simple!

2539	App is stuck on "You Already Answered" error after filling in survey at the time of registration.	2
2540	Useless app	1
2541	I was using it mainly for the radius alerts. I think you're overriding the previous state of the pins with every new update. Which makes it slightly problematic considering that's the one feature that made this application really useful.	2
2542	Easy download. Non invasive info. Runs in the background. Like the invite you can send others to encourage to download. Anything to track covid and stay safe is gotta be good and will help us all get back to some kind of normality. Like that the gvt are trying different things.	0
2543	I can't even register my particulars with the app. It keeps on saying "verification failed; check all fields in red", this is despite me putting in all my details correctly.	2
2544	Very bad app results not appear for 3 days and I missed my flight , UAE Government should find another method for PCR results	1

2551	Useless app. Zap my battery life from 100% to 0% within 1 hour. Every time I pass by somebody, the Bluetooth function went berserk and start sending proximity signals nonstop. Really funny app worse than Pok\u00e9mon go.	1
2552	Smart for making this app to make people safer. Thank you.	0
2553	Great app, download this so we can defeat the virus and go back to our life before COVID19, for those of you who are concern about your personal data being collected, just want to say.. Mate your life is not that interesting. Get over it , and help fight this virus. Dont be a prick.	0
2554	It doesn't accept my phone number. I am using the international format ie. I dropped the 0.	2
2555	App only alerts you of a “possible exposure” weeks after you were in contact with or possibly near to an infected person. Unreliable and putting peoples lives at risk!	2
2556	its stupid, as students cannot do anyting as NRIC below 17 cannot then student pass is for the foreigners then Singaporean below 17 do what ? cannot sign up ?	2
2557	1. Sos! Can add taxi receipt scanner? Not first time i couldnt scan in a taxi i flagged on street.. Not sure what i can do when my phone was flat and cant scan taxi qr code.

2616	Shows false Alarms : One of my colleague's got a false alarm of being 'Covid Positive / Red ðŸ”´ Status' and rest of the colleagues got the 'Orange / yellow statuses'. Eventually Arogya setu is mandatory at workplaces and Airports. Eventually we are not being allowed at workplace and the ones who had their journey planned had to unnecessarily suffer due to the false alarms by the Arogya setu app!	2

2619	Too many bluetooth disconnections coming from this app. My troubleshooting days on finding out the cause has finally led me here.. Low community usage is due to the unusability and issues caused by TT. Please FIX IT..	2
2620	Does this app use Google's Covid-19 tracer android API? I couldn't enable Google's covid-19 exposure notification from my phone settings because it asks for a participating app, even after installing this app.	1
2621	PLEASE GIVE IT MINUS RATING	1
2622	What happen to this apps its crashing....?	2

2631	Don't understand why the app required me to input issue date of NRIC, which meant having to search for the physical card. If you want people to use the app, only collect necessary info for contact tracing. Minimize the steps users must go through for a higher sign up/retention rate.	2

2645	Why does the app not work with Exposure Notification from Google and apple?	2
2646	As mentioned it is a great app, for those able to get it. I agree with all those that are calling for the app to be more widely available across older devices/operating systems. Very important! Not only is it important for those that might be in the highest risk categories who might benefit most from this app, but also those that are already able download it. The more people using the app the better it will work at serving its cause.	0

2660	The apple iOS version of this app gives weekly notifications saying you haven't come into contact with anyone covid positive. Why doesn't it do that for android? How can we have confidence that notifications are on and will tell you when you've come into contact with a positive case when the two versions do different things, and android doesn't even give you a weekly round up?	2

I knew I was taking a gamble by downloading this app, taking in account the experiences I have had with other government applications, but now I am sure that I shan't ever download one of these things again. It's simply appalling.	2
2707	This is a very good app protect us against the covid-19.

2736	Works well except for yes, newer bluetooth transmissions will interfere with app getting location signals. Example: a colleague sends me a document at work through Bluetooth because there is no WiFi or email in the cold freezer. That doc will interrupt and cancel location-tracing signals. In other words, it is not foolproof. Will govt arrest those who switch off their Bluetooth? What abt those working from home in essential services? This does not allow me to give a fuller review.	2
2737	Very good app and I think it great idea but easy too forget about it and to update your symptom tracker. it would be better if there was a notification daily that asks how if feeling good with no symptoms and u can just tap yes or no.	0

2755	Good One but If A person doesn’t register it then it has no value so i am requesting government to Register all by going everyones house and giving them ID And pass then it will be actually worthy. Hope this will be done as soon as possible. If wait for a person to come in hospital and then you will register him or her then it will be too late as many of us try to hide it as we are not habituates in living maintaining social distance and we dont know how to manage it,so	0

2764	Just one little improvement ?? Could the App actually give more details on Covid-19 symptoms. "I'm good, no symptoms" sounds a bit too casual without the details of possible symptoms. Sounds like this app was written by some wannabe cool kid (who has failed miserably).	2

Other users hv mentioned abt Bluetooth connection w rgd 2 connecting to BT speakers, in my case, in the car. The music keeps stopping intermittently and once I've deleted the app, it is completely fine.

2874	App has issues when locked and then nags you via notifications to open the app, too bad if you are using your device as a map/gps/watching a show on a commute etc.  The failings of this app are that they didn't adopt the framework made by Apple that would have allowed background and locked collection.  After a few weeks of nagging I uninstalled it, it's nagged me more times then what the state health service has used the data for all devices for.	1

2883	The app needs some revision. It's just spoiling our mobiles. Battery drains off and needs to be charged all the time. And I don't know if only with my mobile, the screen gets open on its own and is slow and pauses while using. More than satisfaction it's being a nuisance. Hope u you all can do some upgrade.	1

2893	Nice thanks	0
2894	I'm a first responder but deleted the app because of its bluetooth hogging and battery consumption issues, plus it seems to just stop working, especially after turning my phone into a pocket heater. I reckon this is exactly the sort of terribly optimised app we can expect from the government and as such it needs plenty of fixes before I reinstall it. Then of course there's the security side of things. Look at the government's track record with My Health and others being hacked, not good.	1
2895	Before downloading this app read this review. True story My dad tested covid positive in September and he informed the app about this but when my mom checked on this app it shows "you are safe" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ This app is completely fake	1
2896	I get why people would be unhappy about the app draining phone batteries. The idea is great... but its bypassing a lot of precautions and restrictions to stay awake and pull bluetooth information (polling), and agressive pinned notifications tend to be the most annoying type. Phone OS updates should help reduce wakelocks Other than that, it doesn't do much beyond tracking bluetooth IDs, like WiFi names, your phone/SIM network has your geo location, google/apple do too. Theyre beyond invasive.	1

2898	After installing yr app, it kept disrupting my bluetooth player at paused. But once I have uninstalled your app, my bluetooth player works fine without interruptions. Please fix the problem asap.	2
2899	I have a month-old phone and I still needed to update my OS to download this app. This app is more effective the more people that use it, but it’s extremely inaccessible since you have to have the most recent OS. I wish they would change that!	2

Czechs don't like user friendly apps? Come on! Apparently Czech society does not like UI friendly app, it seems Czechs are different to any other nation, which has UI friendly corona apps, which then get used more often. Perhaps we just have not so intelligent health ministry and their app developers...	1
2908	I believe it would be better if app gives approximate(offcourse actual location cannot be given due to data privacy issues) location or area of covid positive cases so that other people can avoid visits to those areas. The current numbers don't give a picture from where the new cases are coming, even a county wise daily detail would help.	0
2909	Edit: Seems to be working again since mid-December. I'm leaving one-star review due to no developer response and extremely long time to fix such a basic problem for such a critical service! Henter ikke længere smitteliste (siden ultimo oktober), medmindre jeg selv starter appen. 22. nov: Hallo er her nogen? Henter stadigvæk ikke smittelisten. 5 ud af 5 tilfældige kollegaer jeg har spurgt har samme problem. Virker det overhovedet for nogen?!?	0

2912	Had this app since introduced with no issues. However, after the update the battery use is ridiculous. It uses far more battery in the background(at home alone) than any other actively used app i have. Needs to be addressed if you hope to have more people instal.	1
2913	Great to see Canada get onboard with an exposure notification app. Especially great to see us adopting the Apple-Google framework.\n\nWhy? It’s anonymous and privacy preserving, runs in the background without draining your battery and has teams all around the world looking at it so will be continually evaluated and improved. \n\nLet’s keep Canada moving forward, together we can defeat COVID-19! Download the app today, and invite your friends and family	0

ORIGINAL4* REVIEW: Found, downloaded and installed OK, verified with phone number/pin etc. The Covid Safe icon is on my taskbar and notifications drop down. Clicking on notification opens App, but actual App icon on my "Desktop" or homepage is not available. If this app works as designed it should be an invaluable tool in contacts tracing of infected people.	1
3026	Ganta	1
3027	Excellent	0
3028	Easy to install and register	0
3029	A week after using this app, it logged out by itself, so I had to log in again, then the icon status went question mark and message updates went blank even though I updated EHTERAZ. Pls. help.	2
3030	Waste of time. The app won't send a pin to my phone. I've checked the help section and none are the reason why it won't work. Even uninstalled and reinstalled the app.	1
3031	Good	0
3032	This is good for safe to people by covid-19	0
3033	Good	0
3034	Amazing initiative by UAE govt	0
3035	This app should have a QR code reader built in for venue check-ins. Then state governments could mandate it be used for all check-ins. That would get more people using it.	0
3036	Unable download . For tracking it needs location why Gov want personal contact no?	1
3037	I cannot register to this app. The Nationality bar cannot be filled.	2
3038	I like the idea and think the app might be useful, but as it requires bluetooth and GPS on, it's gonna drain the battery really quickly	0
3039	Everybody's main concern for a contact tracing app made by the government is "Will this track my location?" This is a completely valid concern seeing as mass surveillance has been a growing concern in the digital age. This app accomplishes privacy in two ways: only using Bluetooth to check if you've been next to someone infected with coronavirus and using encrypted anonymous data. This app is also secure as the code is 100% open source for everybody to view.	0
3040	Never worked	1
3041	The app has to much problem i don't know why all these when i try to sign in with QID and mobile number it loads good but the big problem getting the codes even if i request again it still have the same issue ,and more even if i uninstall it i do the update same problem i do face .so how can i manage the login may i have help plz .	2
3042	Nice and usefull	0
3043	Very Good	0
3044	They're saying the app has been fixed but the last update was on July 18th? Battery drainer on all phones, I work in a phone shop and have had 2-3 people a day with issues.	1
3045	Want to learn	0
3046	Can't even registered. Said that there's error in details. I rather wait for the token to be distributed. Or else don't go anywhere at all.	2
3047	awesome	0
3048	The App is legit and working. Low rating is because of some people trying to activate the app before the government's announced take off time. Download it now to keep track of possibly contacting infected people!	0
3049	Date of issue of IC is irrelevant for contact tracing. MOH has no authority to collect such data over and above the necessary info.	2
3050	Minor bug If your not on the standard route it is always showing ???? "Location Service activated" on the Android notification bar and cannot be removed, only after restarting the phone/app Using Pixel 3 xl.	1
3051	I can't open mine, it's only questionmark I already uninstalled and install it again but still desame always questionmark. Can someone pls tell me why?	2
3052	20/3 tip: the OTP always doesnt work on the first try. Hard close the app and try again and it will work. \n\nI think its a great idea but hopefully it will be able to work with the app in the background instead.\n\nTo all the negative nancys out there, yes there are bugs and yes the app is not perfect but its a start and a good idea in the very least. If you are socially responsible enough, you wouldnt mind keeping if in power save mode in the background. \n\nPersonally, I will listen to music during commute so I will play it in the background while keeping this app on in the foreground. I only use it when i’m in public spaces with crowds so its not a big deal if it has to be on in the foreground for a while to work. If u label this as a useless/lousy app just because you rather watch videos/ scroll through social media than keep this on in the foreground, maybe it just shows what you prioritise as a person.	2
3053	Great idea, get onboard everyone.	0
3054	No tracer option	0
3055	Wouldn't except my phone number	2
3056	Average	0
3057	Nice black theme implementation, I like it! Some of the preliminary text could be condensed and the full counterparts moved into menus though, currently it's long and tedious to read through. Once you're past that, the interface looks intuitive though. Good work!	0
3058	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0
3059	it does not let me register.. all the time wrong information message... both english and arabic version android version 10	2
3060	Waste of time	1
3061	invalid phone number error, despite my entry being correct. Therefore cannot use this!	2
3062	Best app	0
3063	Robbery one of the worst api design I have ever seen.	1
3064	Weak	1
3065	The theory behind the app is great, but it needs to work properly. The notification symbol my phone keeps disappearing, does this mean it's not on and working?	0
3066	Says my numbers incorrect and can't even sign up, it's not incorrect.	2
3067	great!!!!!	0

3070	The more people who use this, the more benefit it provides.	0
3071	Mostly useless	1
3072	The business visa holders cannot use this app, is there any option for them?	2
3073	Simple so far. Language options missing, in addition to '"flexibly exposed status", which may vary unknowingly	0
3074	Very useful	0
3075	Useless	1
3076	the app makes the real physical Identity card useless, which is if u don't have a smart phone, u cannot enter into some premises which solely use this particular app. When facing phone or data issues u cannot even scan ur own IC. Very clever idea indeed.	2
3077	What. is problem	1

3087	Draining battery and phone became overheated. Please fix it.	1
3088	Funny bangali peoples made a funny app. It doesn’t work without net connection, so why need to open Bluetooth? Worst bangali app ever.	1
3089	It was working fine from Day 1 until last night. Woke up to an overheating phone and a drained battery. Uninstalled but the battery is still affected.	1

3098	Does exactly what it states. No issues with listening to music over Bluetooth. I turn the Bluetooth off when home to save on battery, only turn on when outside. Mostly staying Home anyway, so all good battery wise. Would have liked to access to some statistics on how many contacts it picked up, per days, over the rolling 21 days.	1

3113	Apple has just released iOS 12.5 allowing the iPhone 6 to get COVID exposure notifications too, but your app still requires iOS 13.5 and above. And yes iPhone 6 does have Bluetooth Smart. Where’s the update?	2
3114	Good to see the latest update to include older android versions seems to be working my bluetooth headset stops playing for a second when someone's close	1

3121	perfect on devies with Google services BUT how about latest Huawei phones that were not able to run Google apps, it could have been better if can be fixed in an update	2
3122	Lousy app. Can't even register	2
3123	Kise kaam ka nhi hai	1
3124	App not active unless battery optimization is disabled. Unfortunately my phone turns optimization back on again every time I disabled it. It should be "set and forget" instead of having to do this every time I am going out. No good as it is.	2
3125	App should be downloaded by everyone but only time will tell how effective it really is. Regarding information supplied of confirmed cases by area it only gives each county it would be really good if you could get real time information by area within the county.	0

3133	This application really help us about pandemic and it give us confidence that our health will be safe, specially about contact tracing. It really makes us feel secured everytime we go out. The team is great and they assist us so well..God help the team to create this application. Thank you Lord God,	0
3134	This isn't working anymore after a series of install and re-install a QUESTION MARK only shows in the status. Information should be circulated for this event as it will create confusion of whether or not we are allowed to go to work or to buy food stuffs outside.	2
3135	I logged the code from my phone with my doctor when I had the test. I tested positive, got the results via my doctor but the app still says "test result not yet available'. Therefore no contact tracing was achieved via the app. This was almost 2 weeks ago now. Hopefully these issues will be solved soon especially for future interoperability with other apps within the EU.	2
3136	my cannot login	2
3137	No good battery drain and phone also to much heating .	1
3138	This app is not working anymore on Android devices.	2

3142	Failed to register a 1000 times, not receiving OTP. Tried contacting call centre and failed to communicate, they don't respond saying it will take more than 2hrs. Been Waiting outside the grocery stores for hours,as this app is mandatory to buy things now. Sad	0
3143	Good	0
3144	It explains thoroughly what it does at the beginning, and then stays out of your way as expected. And our right to privacy is respected!	0
3145	Worst application Name is correct but mobile number is incorrect...	1
3146	Showing error message while loading "Contact customer support"	1
3147	I have same opinion as Risto Hunt, it could be much more efficient if it could collaborate through API or smth with Finnish Koronavilkku. Because now if people has positive test in Finland on Monday, he must have ability to inform Hoia users, whom he "contacted" on weekends in Estonia and on-board. 56% of Finns uses app 16% only of Estonians (coincidence???)	1
3148	Good app and use full	0

3150	The APP drains my phone battery and what does it do apart from being an extra app on my phone that serves no purpose. Cause about everyone I ask about the APP says that they do not know what it actually does.	2
3151	It was working fine. At least I trusted it. Since yesterday a 1/4 of the information (screen) is to be seen. Somebody knows what the problem is?	2
3152	Battery consumption alot	1

3171	A new update, but still not using the API, will test for 24 hours then remove if the watch stops auto connecting.  Add: now it won\u2019t even uninstall, stays there as a blank icon.  Edit: Installed 1.6, still no Apple API, uninstalled in 30 seconds.	2
3172	Easy to use	0
3173	There is even no developer information from government about this app which is constantly tracing you.	1
3174	Terrible. I put in my mobile number in several times and it kept informing me Invalid number. Frustrating. Have tried many times same result. What else can I do.????	2
3175	Scan entry QR code having problem after update. Error prompt "Error scanning QR code: Please ensure your Google Play Services is update before trying again"	2

3178	Not workibg	1
3179	The app gives good if basic information but I had to uninstall it as it drained my battery in a matter of hours.	1
3180	The app should be installed to at least 80-90% of the population to be effective. A better publicity campaign and easier to understand privacy explanations might be helpful.	0
3181	A quick install. Easy to understand, and there's nothing to be afraid off. Naysayers take off your tinfoil hats	0

3192	I prefer the old version of TraceTogether. This version always disappear. I logged in, and dont know when, it just disappear. I didnt even turn off the bluetooth. By the time I realised it disappered, it is too late as I am already on the bus or already back at home. Just a feedback for improvement.	2

3201	Not good this App	1
3202	Connected to null and "Disconnected from null" messages pop up (toast message) every few minutes. Annoying as hell.	1
3203	This app works just like the government forcing you to switch on the bluetooth draining your battery when your mobile is already low bat. You will received a series prompt of death even when the app is turn off just so that they force your Bluetooth on. This is so much we can expect since they must have outsourced it to some team in India.	1

3309	Good	0
3310	The app should be installed to at least 80-90% of the population to be effective. A better publicity campaign and easier to understand privacy explanations might be helpful.	0

3313	How do you enable Huawei devices without Google Mobile Services to be able to use this app? For example, Mate 30 series, P40 series, etc?	2
3314	This destroyed my battery, most days I'd start on 80% and finish on around 20% with moderate use, after downloading this app I don't even make it a few hours into the day without needing to charge, stuff like this shouldn't be happening with a 4,000 Mah battery.	1
3315	Vary good the System i like this so muse	0
3316	The app doesn't work for my phone.	2
3317	In the last few days my phone has started to freeze up and received notifications relating to high CPU, also had severe battery drain (56% to 0% in space of 2hours - during which phone was not even being used). When checking further, both the Play Services and Covid Tracker app were eating memory. Issue doesnt seem be directly attributed to Covid app, but it relies heavily on Play Services which is the culprit (last update). Clearing the Services cache does help at least!	1

3379	Never works properly (frustrating)	1
3380	Many 1or 2 star reviews are describing a negative experience. I have a Samsung galaxy S8 (Android phone). The app is not intrusive. It has a tiny icon to let you know it's active (which displays upper left of my screen). Notifications are very minimal! Bluetooth battery usage is small. The government privacy statement (which the government encourages you to read before fully installing the app) is very specific and makes it clear that your data is safe from manipulation.	1
3381	Cannot register	2
3382	Good job	0
3383	Not very techno-literate, but I found this app so easy to download. I know not everyone is using it, but I find it very reassuring that more and more people are. My updates are instantaneous and so far so good!! Lol \n\nThank you to the developers and organizations for doing this!!	0

3389	After latest update, the app will close itself with no apparent reason.	2
3390	App won\u2019t accept my mobile number and NO I\u2019m Not using the zero at start of number! Did try once with zero but same result. Keeps saying error verifying number.  iPhone 10 so not old technology. Poor effort	1

3396	I am staying in my home from last one month. Not a single day I went out and no one came to my home but my setu app showed me that I was in high risk as I am in contact with covid patient and according to my app I am come across to covid patient on daily basis and which between 140-165 minutes. Can't understand how is it possible if I am not going out no one come to my home. HOW?	1
3397	After 6 months, I have another chance. Again it's very disappointing. Unable to use without personal identifiers. I don't want to share my phone and id details.	1

3403	Not working with Huawei latest model phone e.g Nova 7i, Nova SE	2
3404	Had to delete the app, was causing my battery to drain far too quick, was barely getting 4 hours from a full charge where I would usually get 24 hours easily. Also, the final straw was when my phone was reporting battery temperatures of 60 degrees or more while idle. Deleted the app yesterday and everything back to normal. Don't download unless looking for a free handwarmer.	1
3405	app turn off by itself even if the phone is not in power saving mode.	2
3406	After entering my one time key, my partners phone has yet to notify him.... almost 24 hours since key was entered. Good idea but possibly creating false sense of security.\n\nUpdate: after rebooting both phones he received the notification DAYS after key was entered. Consent to share was confirmed daily.	2
3407	Very secure and private system	0
3408	When register my contact number, it will send an Otp to my contact, before I am able to enter the otp, it's immediately jump to next page. Pls do something,	2
3409	Facing problem, could not registered yet. Msg received " ID Card Expired" my ID is valid Untill month of Sep 2020.	0
3410	Must have bluetooth on all the time (if you turn off bluetooth the app will stop) also mobile data don't forget to let it change the setting for background mode in Android or you must do it manually. It runs in background mode so no screen just icon top left. Tap on the icon to fill in form. Stays on 24/7. It is in French but Google Translate changes it to English automatically. Running on Doro and Samsung S7 both with Android 7 no problem. You will notice your battery discharge is quicker.	1
3411	Works in theory only IF 1) the whole population has downloaded this app 2) actually has a phone and has it on them when they are out and about, and 3) all users would have to be screened. Unfortunately these criteria severely limit the effectiveness of the app. In terms of the app itself... Doesn't work properly, drains battery quickly and requires GPS usage... Yet another failed government app.	1

3419	I can't start it. Always getting the same message "error getting OTP, try again " and this "try again" never ends. With such an important app in the current scenario, the developer could have done a better job fixing these issues. How can we follow the state's orders if the app doesn't even work?!	2
3420	Turn on bluetooth for the app to work properly, only then you will receive OTP.	2
3421	Will not accept my mobile number. I have tried with and without the 0. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still won't accept my number. Not sure if this is an issue with certain phones - I own a Nokia. Won't get a great uptake if it says your number is invalid when had the same number for 25 years.	2

3513	This occupies my bluetooth and creates connection issues and intermittent dropping out when using my headphones or any bluetooth connected device when making calls, playing music, casting A/V. No good. This is on a galaxy s10+. Also, you can delete the permanent 'protecting' notification on status bar easily. If the bluetooth issue can be fixed, I may re-install it.	2
3514	This is the kind of app that you wish doesn't say anything. That said, the app works fine and all, but it should also help improve a user's peace of mind by allowing the user to test exposure with other consenting users. And it's in English and the Japanese authoruties do take their time to ensure that the exposure system is followed through. This makes it even better than some ancient methods like GPS & check-in.	2

3542	A lot of people around Australia have suffered because of the lockdowns and because of COVID.

3563	Battery drain fixed with an update, the benefits of this app far outweigh the negative of a few days with battery drain.	1
3564	Less than 30 seconds to install and register. If you have ever had anything to do with Aus Gov they already have more info than this app provides them with. I used a pseudonym no problem. It doesn\u2019t ask to use your location services (so no, it\u2019s not a \u2018tracking app\u2019) it only uses Bluetooth signals to ping off other app users (that\u2019s why it asks you to keep app running in background and Bluetooth on).  You enter your mobile number so if a user is diagnosed and they upload their data which has used Bluetooth to ping other users (in close proximity for more than 15mins) by putting our mobile numbers in, it allows the health dept. to be able to contact us, not by using a location service.  If you have any app on your phone that uses location services it\u2019s more invasive than this one. You have to upload your data for it to be accessible, otherwise it is kept on your phone. Even if it did use location services (which it doesn\u2019t) I\u2019d rather give access to the govt of my location for a couple of months than potentially be in ICU, or be responsible for someone else being in ICU.	0

3574	I do like the idea of this app but as always the implementation isn't great. This app kept interfering with Bluetooth connections: my smart watch and car would constantly drop out and need a manual reconnect. No problems since uninstalling it. I'm in Queensland so it's less of an issue!	0
3575	Have to remove it as it drains my battery. Fantastic idea and very important for all to have but the developers need to ensure it doesn't drain batteries. It drains my battery within 5 hours.	1
3576	not beat	0
3577	Good	0
3578	Nice user interface, but always force close when open the application to check the area which is the red zone	2
3579	Keep crack, even if I restarting my phone	2
3580	When first released this app didn't have any issues that concerned me. A subsequent update has resulted in it causing significant battery drain though, with the app now the largest consumer of my phone's battery, using more battery each day than an hour+ of Web browsing.	1
3581	Verry good ap	0
3582	Can the app not constantly show a notification when nothing is happening? I am very tempted to turn off notifications if the notifications is on all the time.	2
3583	I am feeling vey proudful because my own nation created this. It is launched on that time when India and whole world is suffering from coronavirus	0
3584	The app is not working at all.	2
3585	Many times when using the safe entry option I get an error saying not a valid QR code. But if I switch to my phone camera it works perfectly. So there is some problem with the QR scanning on some codes. Also many times I scan a code and the app just gets stuck with spinning blue circle. This seems to happen a lot when I've done safe entry once and then do it again for a second place soon after (eg first safe entry is a mall, second safe entry is a shop within the mall). App not really up to standard at the moment because of these problems, and I am sure it's the app only as using phone camera and web-based safe entry works fine.	2
3586	Doesn't work. I tried several times to receive verification code. Useless app	1
3587	Frustrated.....It sent me one code but when I try to upload data, it won't send me another code.	2
3588	Wow	0

3590	I give up. Reinstalled 3 times and still does not accept my ic. Phuii First verification code also say I input wrong. Phuiii	2
3591	Not a good app to follow, as the COVID radius does not evidence prominent positive cases in an area which may be helpful for people. But it's misleading, exposing general population to infection risk.	2
3592	I tried to keep using it but had to remove it since it broke notifications on the lock screen. Galaxy S20. It would cut off half the notification or not even show some.	1
3593	Easy to install and simple to understand.	0
3594	Disappointing after downloading and installing and being requested to enter a six digit pin that was sent via email that the keyboard to enter any information was not made accessible. Same for ‘required’ name fields, I couldn’t add anything so had to ‘continue’ without completing. Tried to ‘EditProfile’ later and still not possible!	2

3600	Trace together Bluetooth technology eliminates covid19 molecules in the air and keeps me safe	0
3601	1 star because I'm forced to download this but for some reason still required to use safeentry and fill up declaration forms. If this doesn't reduce the forms or SafeEntry I have to fill, I don't see the point of the app. Why is DOB and IC issue date required for tracing? Is there a need to check for spoofing? Have people been registering with other IC? I see I see. So you're saying that SafeEntry is ineffective then?	2
3602	I am not able to fill in the particulars in the profile section. System either rejects my name or NRIC no though the particulars entered are correct.	2

3609	Okay but still unsure if its detecting "live" contacts. I see about 20 strangers a day in downtown Sourhport. How do we know if it's really doing the job?	1

3619	It never works, I just can see starting screen, cant load my profile	1
3620	Unable to update	2
3621	UI is easy and intuitive. What I don't like about this app is that it causes my phone to hang a LOT, drains battery really fast even when I don't turn on scanning mode. Crashes on start-up. I find it hard to believe that there are zero cases in my area or even those with mild symptoms.	0
3622	Very nice	0
3623	What about people who arrived through 'Visa on arrival' and are now stuck in Qatar? the app only allows people with Qatar ID to register so does that make non-Qatar ID holders law breakers? This is important as even the entry to the grocery stores are barred without this app.	2
3624	My family is here with me in jeddah and they are on visit visa , how can they register themselves as they do not have absher , and i am not able to add their names in the app also.	2
3625	5/9/20 update: for a few weeks been thinking my Bluetooth speakers were broken . Then I realised its the covid safe app using the Bluetooth interfering with the signal. Uninstalled the covid safe app and speakers working fine again. I pay $12 a month for spotify and not going to have the covid safe app ruin my music streaming. Would be good if I could turn the covid safe app off when at home and still have Bluetooth on for my speakers. Let me know if I can as I have uninstalled the app.	1
3626	Badly effected on my phone, my husbands phone and my daughter phone depleted batteries almost instantaneously -had no choice had to removed it from all phones even though I was a supporter of the app.	1
3627	Consumes too much battery.	1
3628	I could get airplane tickets after arrived Istanbul because app not send verification code even i try everyday until my fly. After i arrived Istanbul I used bus it was longest travel... When you check daily cases on the map you better multiple with 3 because Turkey's economy in biggest crisis for last 50 years and despite for turistim.	2

3667	While this is a great initiative, I don't feel comfortable providing an app access to photos and other personal folders on the phone. If this access is denied, the app simply closes. Can we please have this access request removed or made optional?	1

I would like to do more to help the community with contact tracing but this buggy app makes it impossible.	1

3865	Funny how you guys are forcing this app on people and using it as a covid-19 excuse. Maybe you should develop a decent working app without all the issues that your app is having. I'd rather get the token before I let you guys screw up my phone.	2
3866	It's a most essential , needful and helpful App . Thanks to , also with highest regards to our "Government of India " , Jai Hind .	0
3867	Stupid app says my number is invalid!!	2
3868	Battery drain on Motorola phone. I also have the battery drain problem so removed the app. I read in the paper that Google rolled an update but nowhere does it state how you can tell if you have received this update. Looking at the system updates tells me device is up-to-date but that the last security patch was the 1/1/2019.	1
3869	I am unable to install the app. this is very irritating as I have to take a flight and I can't fly without the app. it's been a month since I am trying to install it.	2

3873	I did delete the app but so fare the name still appears instead of the service provided and am not if it really deleted or no \nHow come the app could access the ios and change the setting that way ?!!\nI need to remove it completely	1
3874	App contains 13 thousand cases of battery drainage , I tried getting a mask for my oppo phone but it still didn't fix the problem # uninstalled.	1

3886	Unusable as I required to remove cam for my phone. There is not an option to key in the location like in the singpass app.	2
3887	Really bad app because we have to enable bluetooth and location every time.There is no use of them.	2
3888	Battery drain issues appear to be fixed, but I'm afraid the damage has already been done... Having it drain a full battery in a few hours flat is a great way to have the entire country delete the app and wipe out all progress in a matter of days. Good job, guys. Really hope this doesn't happen again...	1

3921	Great app. Works on Bluetooth. Every Aussie should download it.

3931	In order to connect to a Bluetooth device all you should need is Bluetooth permission. The fact that some application may use the Bluetooth connection to determine location, should not force the user to give that app even more permissions. Forcing enabling location is wrong.	1

4014	Worst Experience After Downloaded	1
4015	Would the software be burnt into a chip and incorporate into a handband? If it could - then distribute the handband to all Singaporean and make it mandatory to wear it when leaving the house. No point of wasting time and energy in solving the bluetooth interference with headphones, etc.... The objective is to trace 'closed contact'. It is the effectiveness that counts and it must be abled to seperate data measured at 1 metre distance, 2 metre distance, 3 metre distance, etc..to 10 metre	2

I tried several times to clear cache my phone, restart my phone, OFF and ON the data again, tried for how many days but still the same issue. Seeking for your kind assistance. Thank you.	2
4048	Try to fill up on my personal details, but it keep showed failed on my NRIC column? What's wrong with the apps as all the information I key is correct but I can't process further. Please fix it ASAP if not how can we use this apps and govern how to trace it?	2

4058	Thanks for the ministry and developers. Simple and to the point app. I would add a suggestion: Allow people to load previous history from Google maps to get even more coverage. (Currently the app detects only from time of installation and forward)	0

4063	Keep receiving wrong credentials even i just registered one number..	1
4064	The update description is "bug fixes". Seriously. Changelog link or release notes please? You're expecting trust here. Show some. You also continue to violate open source licenses and fail to release source. I reluctantly installed this in the hope you could do better. Show me you can.	1

4089	Great to find out this app is part of the Linux Foundation public health project, one of few that implement GAEN. Although it does not seem to be the best engineered and truly useful app for the purpose, the UI is good and provides useful stats. Lately, It started draining my phone (Samsung S7) battery at about 1% per min when Bluetooth was kept off at night (keeps polling for BT?) and hogs otherwise, though may not be the case on all phones. IMO use of GPS data along BT might have been useful, BT alone does not seem to be of much use, perhaps it is more of the available phone device platforms that restrict potential capabilities of this app otherwise I am sure the Developers would have done an even excellent job.	1

4093	Works as advertised. Data stays in the device until you personally authorise upload of information. Can't fault this app to help get us back to normal life. Contrary to what some are saying, it had almost zero effect on battery. I can only assume that people complaining about battery are trying to push their barrow to stop other people using the app.	1
4094	Downloaded fine, entered my details but when it came to entering my mob number the app keeps telling me my mob number is invalid.	2

4104	The app works fine for 2-3 weeks, and then it starts crashing when I try to activate it. It's the 3rd times it happens, the only workaround I found is to delete the app and then reinstall. But then it is loosing all of my contact history, so the whole tracing becomes useless, because I now have to choose between loosing my contact tracing history of the last few weeks but have a renewed tracking for the upcoming weeks, or keeping the history and not be able to have tracing for the future.	2
4105	it keeps saying temporarily unavailable so I cannot sign up	2
4106	The fact that this always turns on your Bluetooth and aggressively runs in the background with the notification is a BATTERY DRAINER MONSTER. Their might be a better algorithm for contact tracking, NOT THIS ONE. As an ICT professional, I'm not convinced the way it perform as contact tracer. Sorry but that is how i experienced it and better to uninstall. Salmat	1

I deleted this app initially, but since I visit my clients often recently, I reinstalled it again to be a responsible person. I think it is a good idea to give us an option to switch off this app when we don't need to use it (e.g., sleeping).	1

The App was KILLING my phone battery, using >35% of battery power of phone all the time, and beeping about Bluetooth even when BT was on. Changing the notification setting to disallow Bluetooth alerts really helped to reduce battery usage to 2-6%. Please provide information about how and when to get Covid testing.	0

4135	Very frustrating... at first it was telling me that my mobile number is invalid, then I got to the pin. It accepted the pin the first time, then the second time said the pin was invalid. I have tried 5 times now... maybe I'll try for a 6th time, then forget it.	2

4141	Very easy to register	0
4142	Been able to run with no issues so far. It works great and hasn't affected my phone performance or bluetooth connectivity to any devices.	0
4143	Update: 1) Under Favourites, list should appear based on your location. Already the app takes note of user's location, so why can't Favourites list be included. 2) There should be a notification to remind users to check out after, for example, every 6 hours or so.	2

4154	Everything works well with the app for contact tracing but having the option to put when you got to a place AND when you left would be good and people would probably be more likely to keep trace of that rather than putting it in the details section.	0
4155	Good	0
4156	Very bad app. Whenever I try registering I get the message error requesting OTP even though the details I entered are correct. Please try and improve these issues . It's also not possible to download on Apple devices with iOS below 13.1.	1

4158	A really important initiative I support and encourage all to use however, failed to be able to verify phone number of mobile I\u2019ve been using for 10 years plus. Dropped 0 and added 0 (due +61) but no joy. Appreciate advice on issue or fix. Also, if it makes a difference to loading app, the + 61 will confuse those who haven\u2019t travelled overseas previously which could delay / stop sign ups. Suggest \u2018Help Tip\u2019 on this point. Keep up the good work everyone.	0

4177	Very bad. Not updated and smooth data process. Data anytime motivated.	2
4178	I got through the otp section. When it comes to the personal information I can't pass through it, it kept saying that birthday is invalid. Who are you to correct me for my birthday?! What a joke. Can you input a section for people who are currently serving NS? I forget my IC issued date.	2

4185	It does what's expected. I have no loss of Bluetooth functions. Fitbit & earphones still run ok. It doesn't collect phone numbers, it collects & stores another phone's bt id number, only if near for 15mins. Those numbrs tell you nothing, even if you could see them. The remotely held database dept. knows the registered phone numbers... only if you d/load your BT id collection, only if you are diagnosed with CV-19. Dislike: Notification uses too much bar space. Wld prfr coloured dot on the icon.	2

4244	Thank you for implementing such a wonderful apps. You should keep option for downloading for old version mobile users. Like, a lots of peoples are leaving in Qatar, thouse are using very old model mobile phones. They are suffering now for their old phones, they do not have availability to buy a new phone and now they are not able to come out from their home for their urgency. We can make a option for SMS service system. How we are checking our mobile balance, in the same way you can implement.	0

4255	App has been causing problems with my bluetooth headphones, it sometimes causes the bluetooth to turn off mysteriously. The problem will stop once I force stop the tracetogether app, which is something I don't want happening. Other than that it somehow doesn't eat up an insane amount of battery so good job	2

I had to delete the app again even though I want to use it.	1

4282	It took a while to download and install. However when you first open the app it says "tracing not active " this suggests the app is not running in the background. Working great now.	2

4285	I think it will be good to include in this app with a simple guide on how to keep the app running in the background. As every smartphones these days are equipped with power saving features that will kill the app after idling for a while to save phone battery consumption. This feature can be deactivated, but not many phone users know how to do it.	2

4287	What is happening wirh rhis app?! Why does it log out by itself and gave me headache??!! Lol! Fixed rhis please i cant have back my records... Installed and uninstalled still the result is the same!!	2
4288	Not installed	2
4289	I downloaded the app. I get that someone will notify me if I come into contact with someone who has the app and then tests positive. However, I feel it should give people either daily or weekly updates of places that the person has been and I wonder when two mobile phones that have the app downloaded on the phones - do they react to each other. Another thing is people on the island of ireland both north and south of the island should be able to use both apps together.	2
4290	Battery usage has gone crazy over the past day or so. My phone has started flagging constantly about abnormal battery usage attributed to this app, and that I should disable background use. I figure that would defeat the purpose, so my only option will be to uninstall if it keeps up. Help please!	1
4291	Excellent	0
4292	Tried to do the right thing, installed and used the app. App unable to function without access to location data. Website says location data is not required. Adding my location data to the already questionable database is a deal breaker.	2

4294	So good	0
4295	( edited for later versions) Easy install. Read the help for why it wants but don't need Location turned on ( not sure anymore, but later versions may need GPS on. Getting mixed starus indicators from the apps different icons) . Also it explicitly states that Government and law enforcement can not use it to check social distancing or meetings.	1
4296	I can't open this app..	1
4297	No indication of whether the app works. Growing number of contacts would help.	1
4298	Firstly, this app ABSOLUTELY interrupts wireless Bluetooth audio devices. Every earbud and speaker I've paired with will get distorted audio when it polls/triggers a search of the vicinity. It's so bad that here I am, leaving a 1-star review \u2014 you've got to try it to believe it.	2
4299	Working very slow	1
4300	Useless	1
4301	Don't understand why the app requires the Bluetooth to be on to be operational. I was rather expecting it to require the enabling of GPS. Also quite disappointed by the functionality of it. The app should have shown a dynamic graphical representation of all the Covid-19 patients around within a particular range of me. Until this is done I don't see much of an use for this thing.	2
4302	Its a good application i got 4 hours for a week and i was selected as a first batch to register and its good i will keep my 4 hours for this week safe incase of any emergency thanks	0
4303	So annoying...it keeps telling to turn on my Bluetooth. Why does it need Bluetooth if the internet is on already.... Keeps telling me I'm in the red zone. So...just uninstalled... no use. Sorry\ud83d\ude4f	1

4400	Why must on Bluetooth waste of my battery life phone. Waste of time download this app. Better download other apps no need to on Bluetooth...	2
4401	Battery killer. The app is really good (I wish I could see cases from the graph tho) but since I've installed it my battery is draining so fast. And my Samsund Galaxy S8 is getting warm. I now charge fully my mobile 3 times a day! I have to uninstall it. It's disappointing as the app I well needed and it is at least we can do to get a handle on Covid! I would reinstall if the issue is fixed.	1
4402	i am unable to open the app as i open the app it always crashes and back to home screen kindly fix it	2
4403	Pointless. The idea of the app was to help to automate contact tracing (anyone who has been near the user for a duration over the past 21 days). Government health officials have disclosed that of 6.5 million downloads, there have been exactly zero people it has traced using the app from those who have contracted Covid-19.. So, not sure if it does anything beneficial.	1
4404	The app works... Battery usage is ok. A question/suggestion: how to set the interface language to Dutch? The app is now in English, because my phone is in English.	2

4413	Good idea but it has led to my phone overheating and battery draining very quickly... Which makes it impractical	1
4414	Works fine, easy to register. Everyone who is saying it didn\u2019t work it was because it wasn\u2019t going \u201clive\u201d to enter your mobile number until 6pm EST.	0
4415	Can't knew original information	1
4416	Thank you, very nice and intuitive	0
4417	Not open source, so still a doubtful app. But unusual times, calls for unusual measures. Edit... I stand corrected! Thanks, and will definitely going to take a look at this on Git.	0
4418	I can't log in . It shows exceeded activation. I uinstalled and reinstalled it still no change	2
4419	Very helpful	0
4420	Brilliant idea. Everyone should have this installed.	0
4421	It drains out my mobile phone battery faster than usual.	1
4422	App seems to work well enough but it’s terrible to try and get working.\nFirstly when you sign up, the email code takes too long to come through and the app doesn’t give you long enough to input the code and this was with gigabit connection speeds. Secondly, when you do a password reset, no code comes through at all. Have checked spam folder and everything and still nothing.	1
4423	Full useless app..	1
4424	Edit: Thank you for the feedback. Now it works. Original: Cause 4000, something went wrong http status 901 + a stack trace when you click details, amazing user friendly interface. Thank you very much. Uninstalled.	0

4474	If we check in 2 locations in a mall, the app cannot check out the 1st location separately. I must check out the 2nd location, then can go check out the 1st location. Its quite inconvenient.	2
4475	Keeps stopping when I use another app. Since two updates ago. So basically it's never running on my phone. Have uninstalled and reinstalled, but still crashes.	1
4476	Keeps telling me to check my internet connection. Cant get an OTP. All my other apps work fine, phone calls, sms all works. Except this app...:(	2
4477	Keeps deactivating itself	1
4478	I have tested on 4th may and was looking the result on 5th may but showing wrong credentials and logout and login. My name is showing on the portal but when I clicked it's going to result not available and below notification says wrong credentials . Please help	2
4479	Had a long time to sort out an app and this is what you come up with, Looks good but business I’ve spoken to find the process to create a QR is to hard/complicated for them.\nWhy can’t I add in a location I have visited if the business/organisation does not have the QR code.......... I’ll keep it for a week and then delete it if I can’t find business displaying QR codes	1
4480	Why the group check in is not available in the andriod version? Please update with this feature as it is much more convenient when visit in group.	2

4495	If battery usage is all you have to complain about, then this app is working perfectly. I turn my Bluetooth off when I'm at home when it's not needed. I hope more people download this app to keep our wee country safe. And to the conspiracy theorists who believe that COVID-19 is a 'hoax', go back to school or keep your uneducated & baseless assertions to yourself. Idiots.	0
4496	Very useful app but is draining my battery and causing my phone to overheat	0
4497	Great app. You have to be invited in order to register	0
4498	Great idea, but my phone doesnt keep the app active claiming abnormal battery usage. I have turned off battery saving for the app but it still disables it.	1
4499	This app causing Bluetooth earbud interruption?	2
4500	Not able to log in. Its mentioning - an error has occured. account creation failed	2
4501	Though most of the users expressed their dissatisfaction on the app, time and again you are asking them to share the details on the e mail. Please inform how the app is helping people to to warn them if they come in close proximity of those who were affected by covid 19?	0
4502	Since my last update today, it keeps telling me I have exceeded the activite, i contact 109, the said technical team would contact me till now, what exactly is happening.	2
4503	It's trash I made the test on 20 MAY 2020 and until now no result	1
4504	It seems fine like other corona apps but I keep getting these error messages: Cause 4000: Something went wrong. Error during web request.	0

4507	Excellent \ud83d\udc4c	0
4508	A great initiative by our government but the programmers should consider to update the app to run in the background. \n\nI don’t think the older generation is aware that you have to have the phone ON at all times for this app to work and that they should use the “power save mode”. If while having a meal at a restaurant, and your phone’s screen turns off, the app will not work based on the “power save mode” instructions. \n\nIt is also currently unclear if we need to be on the app at such times or can it run while whilst we are on other apps? \n\nI hope the app can improve soonest! \nThank you for working tirelessly in the meantime!	0

4511	Very easy to install. Just where it says 'wrong number?' (to confirm the number), people might think they've put in a wrong number. It should say 'is this the correct number. do you want to change the number?'	0
4512	Decided to pull the app off my devices. A10 battery stats - app has high battery drain while running in background. I'm not a tech guy, but I'm eliminating apps that suck juice.. On stock Android 9, I had problem. So i decided to use custom ROM on A10 (just before the devs replied, so I couldn't follow up since different OS). When paused, can't even back out of the app which means it's actually in foreground. Play Store says app may not be optimised for my device. I go get token. Stay safe!	1
4513	Good	0
4514	Not very clever if we Android users have to activate GPS, and cannot use power saving mode. These 2 functions have to be turned on and use battery...	1

4564	After tested corona positive, the app doesn't change status automatically. After entering detail of tested corona positive in the app, status doesn't change after 3 days also.	2
4565	Does what it should, and with a great minimalistic UI. Love that the 'little dev company' has proven the Big Four wrong!	0
4566	You guys at least come up with a solution coz now the app stopped working with out you notifying us and yet it's working as the key to everywhere we go for most of us.	0
4567	Nice black theme implementation, I like it! Some of the preliminary text could be condensed and the full counterparts moved into menus though, currently it's long and tedious to read through. Once you're past that, the interface looks intuitive though. Good work!	0

4570	Downloaded the Covid Tracker app as soon as it was launched & it seemed to be working fine with no issues until this weekend when my battery drained down from fully charged to 3% in a couple of hours although I hadn't been using my phone. I heard there was a problem with the app so deleted it but just reinstalled it having heard that the app had been updated yesterday & the battery issue was now resolved. Strangely enough when I reinstalled the app the date of the last update is July...	1
4571	Good app against corona	0
4572	Best	0
4573	The app has stopped working since the last update that happened on 14th July! I tried reinstalling as well but didn't work. Please fix it! Thank you.	2
4574	1 month it isn't working. A month I can't go out. One month I call you everyday and that you say someone will call me a'd then you lie a'd said you changed the status to urgent. One month you keep on lying. One month that you tell me to force stop a'd clear data to try from another phone. One month nothing works and you don't care. One month I can't go to the grocery to the hospital, nothing. One month you keep on lying. One month you pretend you do something but you don't	2
4575	Is the battery drain issue STILL not fixed? I appreciate that this was caused by a problem introduced by a Google Play Services update, but surely this should already be addressed by now - it's been several days. My wife's phone was affected, and I had to clear data from Google Play Services to fix that, and it's been fine since, but still... This issue has undermined all your efforts, and it needs to be resolved sooner than this.	1
4576	Useless	1
4577	The worst application I saw which developed by a goverment. I was trying to buy a ticket for more than two hours and the application doesn't support, cracked and not even typing inside Father name and date of birth and every time it shows failed. The application to be changed soon	1
4578	Since the last update my Bluetooth either won't connect to devices or dropouts constantly on devices I have never had issues with. Update soon or I will remove the so forever.	1
4579	No problems installing but it absolutely chews through battery. New S10+ used to last a full day. I head to charge it at midday just to use the rest off the day. Once again down to 40% after only 3 hours.	1

4585	Installs in a sec and just runs in background. Excellent explanations on utility, privacy and security - very detailed and convincing. Gives you a feeling that serious people are on it so any glitches should be fixed soon, just retry in a day.	0
4586	Unable to register. Tells me my phone number is invalid.	2
4587	Most stupid application. Why can it use GPS/Mobile cells/Public WiFi access point to access user location but only Bluetooth, which is only at a short distance. And only works if another party also has Bluetooth turn on? Please learn how Korea do it! PS, don't use private information as a excuse. Telco has these information all along. Work with Telco etc to get these info. No one is asking you to release these info to public. But is a important tracking information if one get Covid-19.	1

4592	I want this app to work...but it's stopping other apps from working and my phone screen turns on by itself at random points during the day. I'm not going out much at all atm- I'll reinstall and try it again next week and hope it's been updated.	2

4614	This app is not a user friendly. The app need also the internet connection and bluetooth simultaneously. Why not reprogram it where the user acct is still in log-in state even if it is not in used. Whereas the user will just need to on their bluetooth to scan the surrounding for possible covid-19 infected(pui, pum, positive) It doesn't detect any active users around the vicinity even if the bluetooth is on. You can also add a map feature of the area of the user where the 5m-305m are shown.	1

4634	Can't share my results	1
4635	The app bluetooth polling interested with my use of the phone as a wifi hotspot causing the internet to drop out every few minutes. I am using. Moto e5. This means I will turn of. Bluetooth when running a wifi hotspot. Please fix.	1
4636	Not sure is my device problem or this app, while this app is on my bluetooth earpiece always will have interruption, after delete this app the bluetooth earpiece become normal	2
4637	I can't even get in I gave all the correct data even the OTP I put was correct but they say it was wrong!\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c I reinstall it same problem.	2
4638	Always I receive a temporarily error message. I cant use this app. Approximately 2 months before it was working stable but now it's not usable for me. I think it caused by language problem. Even if not, there isn't a report bug button in app...	2
4639	In the process of installing, on entering my TPG no., it says "This is not a valid Singapore Mobile Number". Can someone look into it?	2

4644	Good app i like it and very easy	0
4645	Awful. Kept switching itself off and, as far as I'm aware, never helped trace anything. Certainly never saw anything that said it worked. If it gave some public benefit I'd keep it, but I haven't seen any benefit and I'd rather not give governments access to my movements if it doesn't help anyone. Bye	2
4646	Does not accept my valid phone number	2
4647	No problem installing and going through the registration process was easy. I view using this app as being about protecting myself, family, friends and community. Privacy risk is meaningless when comes to a life and death situation.	0
4648	Very good	0
4649	Useless app.... Just for showcase purpose.... 3 weeks back when I was suffering from COVID-19, this app was showing me "Safe" even if aadhaar card details were taken during testing. When I have myself updated my status as Covid-19 positive, then also it was showing me as "Safe". Now after recovering from Covid-19, then also it is showing "Safe". It means in all cases you are ''Safe". Great joke.	1
4650	Phone slow and not really a lot of information	2
4651	Great way of dealing with this terrible virus, and keeping us safe. Thanks!	0
4652	Friendly app If the app could give notifications when the permissions start and end Thank you	0

Power hungry, constant pinging location draning battery and the phone goes hot it is obligated to be installed. COVID 19 or not, Thank you very much for that. Needs heavy optimization and less agressive personal data access .	1
4700	APP is good providing valuable information but Radius Alert function , if you allow me to say is providing insufficient rather incorrect or misleading information. At the moment app is saying about 12k affected people but Radius doesn't give location of all of them , like it says in gujrat there is no patient but we know there are about 150+. Please either improve this function or remove it to avoid any misunderstanding by the commons citizen. Thanks for your patience. BR.	2
4701	Unable to use as says my phone number is invalid. Tried to It a couple of times, with and without the 0 but still says invalid.	2

4720	Error "Invalid phone number"... I've tried dropping and including the leading zero, restarting the app, restarting to the phone, and waited overnight. I still get the same error and I'm unable to register. You need to explain the errors better instead of wasting our time; "not enough numbers", "include leading zero", "unable to send pin because of network congestion, try again in a few hours", "phone or OS incompatible", "incompatible with phone service provider"	2

4733	Works fine. Excellent design re security, private data etc. It doesn't ask special permissions, and it doesnt send anything to the Govt unless you are exposed to or have the virus and they ask you to press a button on the app to send them the phone numbers of people near you for a while, and no location data. This is pretty well designed and appears safe...no real security/privacy data issues to be concerned about.	0
4734	Bad	1
4735	App still prompt error with certain qr code . If not, query takes forever till timeout with error respond. Support provided was template reply from tech support. I've the latest version of the app. App is not stable. Do something about it	2
4736	How can we use this app for non camera phone? Are you able to add something for copy and paste of the location address? Like the Safe Entry Access.	2

4744	Alright, after rectification with the CSOs, the issue has been resolved. A suggestion would be to add a button for a camera scan where automatic *Check In/Out* occurs on camera scan. This is mostly for the older demographics who uses smartphones but are less literate. This autonomous check in/out only requires them to scan the QR code where they can also choose to tap to show the existing NRIC. Better to have more option for them.	2

4756	PEOPLE NEED TO BE AWARE FOR THE APP TO BE SUCESSFUL U NEED TO ALWAYS LEAVE YOUR BLUETOOTH ON AND PHONE ON AT ALL TIMES ... LEAVE YOUR BLUETOOTH ON EVERYBODY	1
4757	Couldn't register. It keeps telling mw something is wrong. So I have to keep refreshing/changing the OTP.	2
4758	App is interfering with all my Bluetooth earphones making them disconnect and connect especially when in crowded places. Fix this asap.	2
4759	How i can use the app if it wont send me a pin to verify my number	2
4760	I'll suggest the government open up all the electricity power points in public places like bus stop, interchanges, mrt, malls, hdb, everywhere so that we can recharge our phone whenever needed. This app is draining off our phone battery. Seriously, COVID-19 is not a very threatening virus. Media has over played this. Outside SG, everywhere doctors are already coming out to say the virus mortality rate is less than 1%. In SG, out of 58,046 cases only 28 died from it. That's 0.048%! V low!!!	1
4761	Thanks our government to launch the app but it need to improve a lot	0
4762	Although i got an error message saying the otp was wrong, when i clicked 'resend otp' it lets me proceed with the rest of the setup and the app is now working for me. In case u get the same issue, try this trick. App may have setup issues for some of us, but not everyone gets these issues, so try the app for urself. Let's aim to get as many pple on the app as possible so it can keep us all safe & stop covid-19 without shutting down our city.	2

4778	great initiative to help each other with this app, however disagree with the idea of putting the phone face down whereby the phone is the most dirty. yes i understand, it is one of the ways to save battery on iPhone as it closes/dims the phone screen. hmm... i hope developers can assist or find another way to keep this running in the background without users putting phones facing it down on tables or surfaces. a big thank you for all the efforts!	0

4780	After swiping away the app, my phone would hang or having connectivity issues. I’m not so sure if it’s due to the app or recent iOS update or what	1
4781	So far, so good. No effect on my phone's battery! And no concerns about privacy - this is a well designed app with intelligent features to protect privacy. Everyone in Australia who can use this app MUST use the app. You need to know if you've been close to an infected person & as a nation, we need to survive COVID-19. Any country which eradicates it early will prosper economically versus countries like the USA & China which will suffer from devastating infections for years. Download now please.	0

Communication connections are fine with every other app.	0
4809	After I updated the app it stopped working. I reinstalled it and cleared cashe but still isn't working. 109 are not answering the phone. This has been my situation for a week now. This is not acceptable service for a mandatory app!!	2
4810	My opinion, Every one should install this app	0
4811	This app works just like the government forcing you to switch on the bluetooth draining your battery when your mobile is already low bat. You will received a series prompt of death even when the app is turn off just so that they force your Bluetooth on. This is so much we can expect since they must have outsourced it to some team in India.	1

4914	Ehreraz had a problem with showing question mark in my mobile after software update. I had called 109 and their solution worked. We have to go to settings -apps -ehteraz -storage and click on clear data and clear cache. Then go back to previous menu and click on force stop app. Then switch off mobile phone and start only after 20 minutes. Once restart open the app and it will ask us to register again. This solution worked for me. Hope this helps.	2
4915	Whenever it asks for permission to access my data, and I deny, it crashes, making the app ineffective and useless. It only works if I grant permission, and the permission includes: 1) Access to all pictures, media and files 2) The ability to make and manage phone calls 3) Your location at all times I will not give the app these permissions without any justification. Please amend this issue. Do not download unknowingly, email the Ministry of Interior for guidance and clarification.	1

4938	This is the worst app,I know some covid patients nearby leaving few meters away but this app does not show any covid patients nearby and saying that there were no covid patients till 1 km,this app does not contain all the data and don't believe that this app works perfectly on covid 19,people need to know information through other people contactless only, don't think that people are safe whatever this app says and don't keep yourself at risk as this app doesn't contain all the data about covid	1
4939	Initially didn't recognize the phone number. Now requires permissions which most likely will ruin my battery very quickly. Was it the only practical way to achieve the purpose?	1
4940	Bad! No notifications at all. If I switch off location or bluetooth - no notification, except if I open the app! Even after updating itself secretly- no notification! Found it by accident! Had to open the app first! I really wonder if I get any warningvif a infected person has been discovered near. Useless! (Samsung Galaxy S 10+)	1

4958	When in proximity of another phone running the app it causes interference with BT audio devices, causing music or podcasts to pause repeatedly for 2 to 5 seconds. Makes it unusable and force stopping it while listening is the only way to stop the interference.	1
4959	Good idea but it drain battery from my iPhone faster then I have time to charge it.	1
4960	Drained my battery. Will not be re-downloading until it's 100% safe to do so. Absolute shambles by all involved.	1

4962	Veey good experience. But people are not aware that it does not automatically show if there's any +ve person nearby you or not unless the same person should need to fillup the required details with true fact eg. if someone has came in contact with any of the COVID patients then he/she must have to admit else the information will be wrong and it'll never indicate to others.

4992	There is a huge and very anoying bug, for some reason your app is causing my device's internet speed to fall dramatically (from 20 mbps to 14 kbps) and no, it's not my router, its not my settings, it's literally just your app. When i installed it, it immediately throttled down my internet speed, and right after i uninstalled it, it immediately jumps back to normal speed. Please fix this, this is not only bothersome, but also suspicious. Saya udah tunggu 5 bulan lebih cuk _-_	2
4993	Kills battery's, after installing the app I charged my phone overnight and it was very warm in the morning, the battery dropped from 100% to 9% by lunchtime and still very warm I tried every setting to fix the battery depletion but I eventually had too uninstall this app and so far so good! Not happy hopefully it hasn't killed my phone!	1

5005	Useless app. It downloads but will not open at all. Always showing app crashed. Tried across multiple devices. Still nothing. Even the website seha.ae is useless. Created an account for my dad to check his results for swab test at a drive through centre which he took in the last week of May 2020. Still no report whatsoever. Neither by sms nor by email. Emailed them asking for the report last week. Still no response. Absolute waste of time!!	1

5013	Dear developer did not recognize my OTP number please fix this issue thanks..	2
5014	Significant battery drain as app need to disable battery optimisation operating 24/7. Need to utilise an option where app is on only when outside of home if battery optimisation needs to be disabled to work.	1
5015	I've just started using it for a week, the scanning of QR Code is definitely better than Singpass. However, I hope you can adopt some improvements that are recently added after user feedback in Singpass. Pls consider viewing all Sign Ins for the forgetful and reorder Favourites to take full advantage of it. Keep up the good work.	0

We are in another war at the moment and we can help fight this war by downloading this app. The only information it requires is your name, phone number and postcode.

5070	Very useful app and needed during current times but it was draining my battery. I usually get 1 to 2 days from my battery but i had to charge my phone 4 times in 1 day because of this app. I had to uninstall, i hope this is rectified soon so that i can install the app again later on.	0
5071	It's secure and uses almost no battery. I have used this over 2 weeks and it has just used 0.2% of my battery, also it's more secure then the one from my home country. Overall I'm very impressed and I would hope everyone in Ireland would use this	0
5072	Please help me understand, my other QR reader able to scan safe entry, but your inapp scanner reply that the same code is not a safe entry code? I have uninstalled, restarted phone, reinstalled, and still same error, why is this trace together app so useless?	2

5092	UPDATE 08/08/20 Had the battery draining issue experienced by others and had to uninstall. I'm using a Samsung A7 on Android 10. I'm not aware of any other apps that updated on my phone that day. Great UI/UX. Easy to get started and navigate. Clear explanation text. Would like to be able to expand Daily confirmed cases graph. Wondering what rounding is used for percentages on Check-ins and how recent spread data is.	1
5093	Doesn't work when immediately downloaded, but definitely a smart system!	2
5094	Traffic overload. Always getting failed responses on registering, sending otp, adding family, protect me button, covid updates, more.	2
5095	Doesnt support basic functionality of SingPass Track and Trace app such as favourite locations nearby. Bluetooth consumption is far too excessive and prevents this being a realistically useful app. QR scan reading is prone to fail. Full SD card access is an invasion to privacy - it should not have this permission. Sorry but I don't trust this to not be abused.	2
5096	Chews through my battery which normally lasts 3 days but since getting this app im down to 9% by night.	1
5097	What's the point of tracing with bluetooth on and consistently needing to run it in the background? Having bluetooth on without using is prone to hacking. Why don't you guys use Google's geo tagging capability and not into some old school methods?	2
5098	Why like this,, I cant registered at the end its I'd expired but my I'd until november	2
5099	May I know why is the OTP not working? Apparently what waa sent wasnt the actual otp code.	2
5100	Not Working at all	2
5101	Not getting access to my files. Just control and invasion of privacy. If you want people to use it then fix it!	1

5110	Cannot add my daughter or any other dependants but my wife can on her iPhone. Not sure why the android version has less features	2
5111	In Android it's not possible to allow the app to use the location in the background. Only "while in use" and "ask everytime" options are possible. So I can't "activate" the app	1
5112	Was working fine till 4 days ago , now my phone keeps overheating & battery is been drained. To use app have to charge phone x3 times a day. Please fix as want to use app.	1
5113	Finally got it working, after countless times of trial and error. Hopefully it can detect what error exactly. Hate guessing game.	2
5114	Much better big improvement to before I can feel safe in work now knowing I am tracked	0

5116	Able to register with no problems. Obviously as it has just been released, everything is super busy with people trying to register so please be patient and try again later!	0

5118	Satisfactory	0
5119	Great App to monitor your health and your love ones.. also gives you updates on statistics on covid 19	0
5120	The app is eating my batteries life. There been no notification on the app to say there was a problem. The information given on the App is pretty useless. The App could have been used to communicate information about ongoing corvid activities such as lockdown events, use of face covering, the daily figures issued by the HSE. The HSE are missing an opportunity to communicate relevant information to App users. The App is a good idea but could be utilised more.	1

5197	The may 12 version crashes during stratup. Older version worked better.	2
5198	I am not able to log in. Was able to use it earlier but after opening it 15 days later and its not allowing me to log in	2
5199	I updated this app in 28th July, since then it is not being opened . And so many reviews are relevant to my problem so admin is requested to settle down this issue immediately please	2
5200	Best but not updating	0
5201	This app good but but some time showing wrong report. Because before 22 June to 4 July I have to done 4 tests positive. Then 5 July morning around 8 am i have to done test night 2:30 am 6 July i get message from burjmedcity NEGATIVE. Then 7 July I have to done confirm test done around 08:00 am the same burjmedcity get NEGATIVE sms 09/07/2020 I'm so happy I have to do one question to the app why they show the 06/07/2020 test positive that date didn't get test	0
5202	Won't accept my phone number, says number is invalid. Not sure why. Will try again at a later date. Does the app need an update for this as i see a few reviews with the same issue	2

5205	cannot assign pin	2
5206	Downloaded it yesterday but it won't accept my mobile phone number as it keeps saying it is invalid. Great start...\ud83d\ude2b	2
5207	Very easy to install, does better than commercial apps in protecting privacy, especially as it will probably save lives	0
5208	Does not use google/apple's official exposure notifications api	1
5209	Good	0
5210	Works fine but really hate being hounded to turn when I am at home and there is no possibility of catching Covid. It does drain battery faster so enough of the hounding already. Apart from this it's fine	0
5211	Would be better if we just saw trends instead of daily figures.	1
5212	Seems to have no significant impact on battery life.	1
5213	Flawless	0
5214	Almost great apps. One improvement is maybe to allow the Group Entry to be taken out of the TraceTogether apps like the SafeEntry for single person.	0
5215	Good initiative, but it keeps interfering with my bluetooth earbuds. Spotify, Beyondpod and other music apps keep pausing very 2-3 minutes. Have to restart phone, and don't the app, then everything plays fine.	2
5216	Good	0
5217	I think this app helpful for us..Thank you.Stay home & save our family & save other's & and save our country.plz do not go outside.if really urgent then go.but try to not go outside.	0
5218	I try to put my mobile number in so I can be a responsible citizen but it keeps coming up my number is invalid so I can't get to the next step. Very frustrating	2
5219	Didn't have any problems downloading or registering. So far all good.	0
5220	I know this is mandatory but how do I use this apps if I can't even register my fin and code.	2
5221	Too basic level app, must improve app development	0
5222	Very useful in Qatar	0
5223	Changed my rating to 5 stars. I have emailed about the the way it says "tracing not active" and got a reply. It is working still! "Thank you for contacting us. Please be reassured that the App continues to function in the background a if you have bluetooth and exposure notification and the active notice will reappear at difference speeds depending on phone model etc."	0
5224	I'm happy to have the app on my phone, I'm not worried about any security risks. But I removed one star because Bluetooth is constantly running and there's an icon in my notification tray which won't disappear which is annoying.	0

5231	Am having trouble registering myself (pink IC holder). Its reading my IC as invalid. Amusingly.	2
5232	I am unable to log in	2
5233	Bad service	1
5234	I did every thing and still not working... after i put another mopile number it will be ok	2
5235	If this app is suggesting that "you are in safe zone", then why my area is sealed, "Anarkali market & flat". Is this application issue or mishandling from authorities.	2
5236	I don't see the point in this app. As I checked today 2nd November as I'd accidentally knocked off Bluetooth. Seen it last checked on 12th October. I am a key worker, I could potentially come into contact with this virus. And after 14 days it removes data. So that is a lot of potential contact with this virus missed. If it's not going to work and check then why have it installed?	2
5237	Set up went smoothly.	0
5238	Must include the graphs and last updated time.	2
5239	The app is essential in these times. However it may be useful to add in a reminder feature so people can opt in to get a notification from the app to remind them to track every day.	1
5240	Most lousy app I ever see. Bluetooth running in background is drain my battery fast. Erase immediately after I install it. It suck!	1
5241	Kinda gay	2
5242	Utilize the features of stay home safe app that was developed by China. Alos, make sure to check their other apps, so we learn from them instead of inventing the wheel. \ud83d\ude0a Well done sdaia and nic	1

5252	Great concept to keep us safe. Signing up was easy and I don't feel like it's actually tracking me to the extent some of you make it. Just hooks up to other Bluetooth devices I've been near and informs if they do get infected. I'll do anything to help stop the spread and keep my family safe.	0

5270	Overall experience was good. But since last week its been draining my battery very heavily. My OnePlus which used to stay for almost 1.5 days, started draining out in a few hours. Uninstalled this app and now my phone is back to normal.	1

Now trying to reinstall and i have otp time out and my phone starts over heating with it installed why is it so complicated to update the app on android? Isn't there a better solution.. i am also waiting for the call back from the agents to guide me..	2
5295	App contains a lot of cool integrations which helps people to be aware of their surroundings to help them stay safe in this time of pandemic. The Bluetooth to internet connection is something new to me as a Dev.	0

5297	Tried twice and didn't receive SMS yet to register .	2

And i don't know who created this app and in app they don't create refresh button to refresh the Mobile Number.	1

5301	Government: Download the app! -_- Me: Downloads app-tells me my contact number is incorrect and can't move forward Government: We need everyone in Australia using the app Me: Frustrated because I'm trying to use the app but it won't let me. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!	1
5302	Latest update seems to use a lot of battery, about 1% every hour in the background. Galaxy S9, Android 10.	1

5307	So many reviews indicating a bad app, yet it continues to be bad Battery draining and makes Spotify tracks sound like pirated CDs; jumpy and impossible to listen to. Uninstalled TT app and no issues so very clearly the culprit. Make it decent before pushing it compulsory please!	1
5308	This is not good. I walked out of my flat, took an empty lift and walk passed 2 people to go to the bus stop and it shows 127 exchanges. There is a man and a woman who just came and are sitting 2 meters away. Update 9th July Thank you very much for your prompt response. I get what you mean. It's still scary but I appreciate the effort and trust that I am safe with your reassurance. Am re-rating to more stars.	0
5309	I install this app but i can't oppen this can't register also it was going on background pls help me what to do	2
5310	Lousy app. Can't even register	2
5311	Working well for me. No problems with installing and signing up.	2
5312	Incompatible with my mother's Samsung Galaxy J1 running Android 5.1.1. To be useful as a public health measure, this really needs to have broader compatibility to allow use by people other than those with the latest and greatest hardware.	2
5313	This is an excellent idea. I downloaded it at 11am on Sunday 26th April and was able to register right away but an hour later I couldn't register my fathers phone. However it was able to be registered later in evening without any issues. As to privacy the app only uses Bluetooth it does not use any location data. No real time location. I strongly recommend downloading and registering the app it will make a huge difference in the fight against COVID 19! Do it for Australia and your own family!	0

5322	Worked fine until this weekend. Suddenly started draining my phone battery. Normally my battery lasts 2 days. It now lasts barely 6 hours. Phone is becoming super hot too. Trouble shooted this by turning on developer options on phone. Wiped cache and also wiped cache on Google play store. Uninstalled and reinstalled apps that were recently updated. Discovered this app is to blame. Once uninstalled phone returned to normal operation and battery life. A fix is urgently needed	1
5323	There is no interaction with the app on how it works and why the GPS signal is needed (drains more battery). But you only need to install a GPS emulator app to report a fake location if privacy is your concern.	1
5324	Uses a ton of battery and has 2 constant notifications. If you are home all day why use location and battery 24/7?	1
5325	It's great application and wonderful amazing thank you very much, God bless you Bahrain Team.????	0

5331	I have Samsung Note 8 and unable to install this app. (Many files deleted to open space. Some App. deleted to open spaces. But still EHTERAZ is not getting installed in my phone) Whome should be ref.to ?	2
5332	Drains and melts your battery. Phone so hot it was a fire hazard. Uninstalled and everything back to normal. Crazy!	1
5333	Works well, easy set up, can change app permission preferences without breaking the app if you're concerned, and it's a simple first name last name age range and phone number info required. So it's honestly nothing to stress about. Let's stay safe guys \ud83e\udd19	0

5344	I have asked why my covid test result still not available where in I had my result november 15. Upon registration you need to put the emitates ID and the phone number provided in test center! When i successfully registered I received an error show that my phone number not registered and there is another phone number registered which i dont know! The call centre agent not helpful! Giving me different answers which is not helpful! All i ask is why my result still now showing!!	1
5345	An app that might literally save my or my partner's life. Yes please! Small issue getting the PIN from the SMS then going back into the app to find I had to start the registration process again, but no major problems so far.	0

5348	Contact tracing keeps turnin off shows very little info (where exactly the cases are, r rate etc) and wont show info for the 6 counties, this app will have no benefit unless it is improved	1

5350	I cant open this app..poor apps	2
5351	Very well designed and easy to use. App handles permissions and data very well. Source code for the app is publicly available and I was able to read through it. Everything above board. Highly recommend we all download it so we can beat Covid-19!	0

5358	it doesn't work when I take a selfi it show illegal argument exceptions !!!! please try to fix it	2
5359	And as of today, it still stuck on Get OTP page on a huawei p40 Pro phone..... How like that?	2
5360	Suggest to improvise the app to boost more related tracing features such as to be able to use it to scan SafeEntry QR code, lock the location then if the subject leaves that location, reminds him to check-out. And, to sound an alert when the subject goes to a location a confirmed case had visited with date and time.	2
5361	This is good app but problem is after download this app Mobile is heating too much and which is not good. For that this app need to improve more..	0

We should be able to use it!! ????\n\nThese comments not directed at developers.	1

5384	Takes a very long time to download and set up. Spent two days downloading the app and two more days trying to set up the app to no avail. I can't even get past the otp verification because of how long the app takes to load and this leads to me having to retype my phone number numerous times and the app sending multiple otps to my sms.	2
5385	User-friendly and no battery drain. I didn't have to use the QR code function yet. So much better than the french one lol.	0
5386	It says registrant does not exist	2
5387	Contact Tracing cost should be fully borne to the Singapore Govt and not to residents and tourists.Its a Medical Issue to play safe be it a resident or a visitor.When requested to install and is done so,the system must show as Installed Already to the viewer on the spot.The TT subject is very vague at this point and not easily understood by everyone.It must come as an icon on the handphone so that by touching it must show whether the place you had visited is safe.Simple as as whatsapp message.	2
5388	Had to delete the app due to all the battery issues others have mentioned. My phone has basically become unusable with how quick the battery drains. This used to not happen at all so whatever change was made to cause this issue needs to be fixed. Would happily download it again if the issues is sorted.	1

My phone battery will not even last a few hours with it running, where it can nornally last a day without. What is the point of a dead phone in this case? I hope the developer will never make another app in his or her lifetime.	1
5427	It's impossible to register onto the density section to see the risky areas. Keeps saying verification failed ??	2
5428	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0

5447	Minor issue with Bluetooth headphones cutting out in crowded areas.	1
5448	Had to turn off and turn back on exposure checking because it would not update and check random ids. Didnt generate any when out in shops on thursday.	1
5449	i don't know when i update the app after not open this app	2
5450	Requires personal data 	1
5451	Good	0
5452	The app demands too much power from the phone. Bluetooth would be ok, but Koronavilkku also demands location on to work.	1
5453	How about putting up the amount of people contacted through this app. I was in close contact with someone who tested positive 5 days ago and no one even contacted them about it so we all paid for private testing. So im getting rid of the this app which only tracks you movements and gives you information you can get anywhere	1
5454	Drains battery. Please give option to only activate and use Bluetooth if you're away from the house.	1
5455	This app drains my battery way too much !!! Also, there is no justified explanation to why this app needs to access photos and media on my phone. This app leaves me feeling worried and insecure. It doesn't do the same for Iphone, only Samsung. Why the double-standard?	1
5456	I don't have covid, yet. If I do get it, I'll change my review.	1

5458	Crashes a lot	2
5459	It gives one tension when it says you were in close proximity of infected/high risk person it could also give a warning like a beep or a msg so that one ca be more careful. I have it on 2 devices which always be together with me. Each one of them show different information on contact numbers are quite high like 20 in one 27 in other. Both are always on both has internet on always & blue tooth. They will on me together in one pocket.	0
5460	After the recent updates, the bluetooth exchange count drop significantly. From typical day of over 1500 exchanges to about 300 exchanges and this happened to few of my colleagues. Those din update, still recording over 1500 exchanges. Is this normal? Some installed recently has ZERO!	2
5461	Vgood	0
5462	it's good application	0
5463	After settling into using the app for Months, suddenly without reason or warning my online delivery pharmacist was changed to a "collect only" service from a village chemist miles away. The restoration of normal service was a pain in the ass & only possible by re registration on my chosen chemist's website. It seems to have begun, though its not confirmed. As an interim, prescriptions will be delivered to a chemist shop nearer my home. Why mess about like this!?? Is the app or NHS at fault?	1
5464	Recent updates have screwed with Bluetooth settings on other devices, eg smartwatch, BP monitor. To get them working again had to uninstall and reinstall app...	2
5465	Still show my old result...........	1
5466	After update, application won't running on android 9. Its always keeps Stopping. Please fix it.	2

5473	I really hope this is used widely. I also hope that it becomes a more proactive altering service. Telling me about the locations I wish to go to rather than a retrospective alerting system. Clean design and robust app.	0
5474	There must be some improvement in the app	1
5475	Non invasive	2
5476	There're huge vulnerable segments that this app doesn't reach. These are foreign workers and senior citizens. Most of these users are still on Android Kitkat. Probably 9/10 users in this demographic segment are on Kitkat. This OS is still popular in cheap phones sold to this demographic segment. Phones on Kitkat are still available for retail. I hope you can kindly build support for Kitkat.	2

5500	App was very quick and straight forward to setup and register. Those who had trouble with this may have been entering their mobile number beginning with zero?  The zero needs to be left off. Looking forward to seeing how effective this technology is.	0
5501	Doesn’t recognise any QR codes	1
5502	Poor application... :(	1
5503	Few things you have to look into. Its asking for the number you used when applying for the emirates ID even though your giving your updated number at the center of testing. That means you cant know if ur positive and in contact with others? Then whats the use of the app? It takes long time to generate the results.	1

5555	Very good. As long as the other person has a mobile with this app, enabled with blue tooth and location. Surprised to read reviews without knowing this essential need. When I had to accompany my brother to a hospital during Oct 2020 to meet a nuro surgeon, it has caputured one infected person's presense somewhere around. Disappeared a few weeks latter, may be after a specific weeks or so. I am impressed. Every alternate day I assess myself for MY safety.	0

5560	While it's a good idea, battery life is horrible now my phone is flat before 4pm usually 8/9pm before I need to charge my phone. My phone cuts out when using Bluetooth especially music. Sure with all the tech gurus there could be a better system.	1
5561	Rejected my 15 year old phone number as being invalid. Tried 3 times with and without first zero.	2
5562	no OTP received after trying several times, so could not proceed into the app. edit: have received OTP after trying again yesterday. and thank you to developer for responsing. please keep up the great work!	2
5563	No stock. Upload slowest.	2
5564	After the app was installed my phone and other devices that were already paired started to notify me that they were trying to connect again. I could not find anyway to stop this so i had to uninstall it	2
5565	Excellent application. In current situation This is helpful to recognise others about their Corona Status. This pandemic is a great headache for every country. We don't know how can we return back to our normal life. So We will consider this application as a part of our normal life	0

5602	Can't use the app in combination with the German one. By the way, is it a copy the "Corona Warn App" from Germany???	1
5603	Destroys battery life. Ever since Kildare, Offaly and Laois went back into lockdown, the app constantly runs in the background. It caused my brand new Samsung S20 to go from 100% to 0% in 4 hours. I would usually only charge the phone once every 2 days.	1
5604	This is my second time to download as my phone was having problems last week with it, but im so glad the issues have apparently been sorted. I feel very safe having this app, and once you get in the habit to check in each day it keeps you in check.	0
5605	So using an AWS data centre in Sydney 100% owned by an offshore entity from guess where. Thanks but no thanks. Happy to install if my data is stored in Australia on Australian owned equipment.	2

5607	After the today app update. Alert area is not functioning. App just turned off	2
5608	Fail lah, scanning qr code but constantly gives internet error. Safe entry URLs so much more reliable.	2
5609	Distarbs,too much, sometimes cannot open	2
5610	Good initiative	0
5611	Just look at the negative feedback re battery drain, login issues etc. And the government insists that 70% of the population uses this highly flawed app or the equally problematic token before moving on Phase 3. What a joke.	1
5612	Can not set up. Can't put DOB after 1986 no option for " / "	2

5614	Good initiative	0
5615	Not available for Android 5.0.	2
5616	Samsung S9 and I hardly use my phone so rarely charge. Now I need to charge it constantly. Also the app interferes with bluetooth when listening via headphone. Sorry but I tired and this is just ridiculous, whoever's built this app needs to get speak to someone who knows what they're doing. If google and facebook and our phone companies can track us without this much disruption to our devices why cant this app?	1
5617	Ok. Usefully	0
5618	Safest app to save lives australia	0
5619	1.No Privacy Policy !!! 2.No Terms and Conditions !!! 3.App Request to Grant Too much Permissions.	1
5620	App is great and stores all data in the phone, data is shared only if you get tested positive and you agree to share it. It was 3rd party reviews and they found it totally safe from a privacy point of view. Whoever doesn't download it because of privacy concerns is either misinformed or a fool.	0
5621	Very slow to open. Takes a lot from the battery.. and in many cases it closes before opening.	0
5622	It was good for a laugh, I guess. I don't know who on earth programmed it, but it's... Incomplete. Many of the sentences within it are simply not finished (but if you want to "read terms &" or declare yourself to be "I am 16 or", you're in luck!) and frankly the lack of location/venue check-in and reliance on bluetooth means that this app is basically worthleaa for its intended purpose as well. Do better, HSCNI.	1
5623	The apps ask for too much non essential details, which could be stolen when hacked. This had discouraged many people from signing up. 1. Full NRIC is not needed per PDPA, as the last 4 figures would already enable traceability. 2. Date of issue of NRIC is NOT needed. 3. Birthdate is also NOT needed. The above are NOT necessary for the purpose of contact tracing and should be taken out. Good to have, but not needed. Please reconsider the needs to have these data, in future updates.	2
5624	Why government forcing us to install this app.. Any app installation should be voluntary..	0
5625	Great idea but unfortunately latest update kills my battery. If it isn't fixed soon I'll regrettably have to uninstall it.	1

5629	Does not work. Keeps asking me tip check in, then won't let me...	2
5630	Battery Draining due to GPS need to turn on all the time, while Bluetooth automatically on simultaneously. If turned off GPS, continuous notification sound comes. Similarly, thus Bluetooth turned off intentionally, due to installed app, it automatically turn on again. please fix the issues. App is good except above parts.	1
5631	My phone notifaction coming but no open & some time no rining.i tomuch time contact center call but no answer .can i reinstall ap after register second time .please advice, i am in quratine	2
5632	Worked well. Then after a month got the battery draining error but that's fixed now. No longer draining battery.	1
5633	Was not aware the app store all bluetooth contacts (which can reach up to 20m away). I thought it only stores contacts within 1.5m for 15 minutes. This was deliberately poor communication on the federal government's behalf and a massive breach of privacy.	1

5667	It is a good initiative by government how ever, this app forces users to allow the app access to media files such as photos etc in your phone which is a huge invasion of privacy that is difficult to accept. Please correct this because this has nothing to do with tracking corona.	1
5668	I installed 3x and each time I wanted to upload data after going outside, I am met with the same PIN and "invalid PIN" error. Each time, after trying many ways, I uninstall, reinstall. Then after I go out again, after maybe a week, I try and I'm given the same PIN and same error. I'm now on 4th try to download and install app. But from since 10 AM to now 16:40, the app has not downloaded. I want to contribute, but this will be my 4th and final attempt. Andy	2

5685	Aarogya Setu Team, I have written an email about my concern on your email ID but no one has responded for more than 24 hours. Labs are informing positive patients details to ICMR and then ICMR sending it to Aarogya setu app team. However if releasing report of negative then they are not sending it to ICMR. Ultimately person from positive to negative will always shows positive. And support will not respond to emails.	1

5687	Not working for huawei p40 pro	2
5688	The QR scanner doesn't work on my Huawei Mate 30 pro, it show I need to update on Google play but is ady updated. This app is harder to use compare to other QR code scanner. Not useful at all and more troublesome.	2
5689	Useful but there are some minor problem	0
5690	The app, especially lately, has been affecting my Bluetooth connection with my wireless headphones. The audio will drop out and I'd have to reconnect multiple times. It seems to be worse when near other people. I uninstalled Covidsafe and have had no connection issues since. This is unacceptable.	2
5691	Very impressive and easy to use! QR code recognition is amazing However, it still drains the battery very quickly (Samsung S9)... 3/4 of a day at max. (Thus the "only 3 stars") Would live to have this fixed in order to keep it and not grab a token \ud83d\ude07	1

5697	There isn’t an option to sing up to it,it’s asking us to login directly,which of course it isn’t working because we I’m not yet signed up for me to log in,so how can we use the application if we even can’t get registered?!	2
5698	Good to know that Philippines is embracing modernization thru the filipino-made app, Staysafe.ph that we should be truly proud of. It aids to the government's need of contact tracing, citizen's health condition reporting and social distancing in the midst of COVID 19 outbreak.	0

5704	Unistalled and no more distortion or intermittent disconnection to my Bluetooth devices.	2
5705	Causes bluetooth to turn off and on intermittently when in crowded areas. Making the app unusable if I want to listen to my bluetooth headphones. Same experience with a number of bluetooth headsets.	2
5706	Doesn't work. Says service isn't available and keeps asking to try again later.	2
5707	Burns out battery and made my phone overheat. Had to delete. Went to bed with my phone on 100% and it had died by the following morning. Checked throughout the day and my phone notified me that this app was draining the battery.	1

5711	It looks like I have to restart my phone every morning in order for the app to be able to find device nearby. My phone is Redmi Note 9, about 1 month old only.	2
5712	Really lousy. User interface sucks. Asked for OTP but kept failing to validate.	2
5713	Battery Killer. It's overusing the Google Play Services framework and it consumes a crazy amount of battery, almost 32% of battery usage was from it. I appreciate the commitment to trace and protect us against COVID exposure, but it's of no use if it just drains the battery and you can't even use it.	1
5714	your latest updates got a bug. keeps getting this "connected to Null", then "Disconnected from Null" messages. the messages will appear very often. Tested and confirm to be this app, because the messages stopped appearing once I force stop the app.	2
5715	Better	0
5716	Won't download!??	2
5717	Had to delete the app phone overheating and battery draining.	1
5718	Great app. I have read a few comments from concerned users about needing to have location services enabled on Android. This doesn't mean that the app is using GPS, or tracking your location. It is a limitation of Google Android Software development tools that force the developers to ask for location permission. If you have a look at the code of the app it becomes obvious that GPS is not used. Trust us computer scientists that know what is going on. No degredation in battery performance noticed.	0
5719	this app does not show the latest covid test report and i do not now how this app will know if a person from negative will be positive or will require another test ?	2

5729	I love.	0
5730	Apps like this only work if everybody uses it. I honestly believe it’s one of the best ways to get people to socially distance and keep safe, but I haven’t seen any media push about this app? My wife is a government employed health care worker and even though I’ve been talking about this for months, she didn’t even know it was out there. A random search for “Covid” on the App Store is how I found it. \n\nYou need to make a bigger effort to inform people about this app, and educate them on how to install it.	2
5731	Excellent app for ongoing situation.	0
5732	No OTP coming yet. Still waiting	2
5733	A lot of people seem to be having an issue with registering.  I\u2019ve downloaded the app, added phone no. etc with no issues.  Check the app again guys. I\u2019d say problem has been fixed.	0
5734	After doing a check in. Unable to do a check out in the later part. Use to be able to find the check out but now no longer	2
5735	Very good app	0
5736	lol I couldn't even register my number, I clicked "register" a hundred times now but I didn't even receive a single OTP ?????????	2
5737	The application is mandatory for all resindents in the country. However, It's not supported in old version of android. There are people who are unable to buy a new phone due to financial circumstances. Those needs special attention as they are struggling to reach grocesseries to buy thier daily stuffs.	2
5738	A very poor system indeed- the app does not tell you WHERE  you were in close contact with an ‘infected’ person I may have passed someone in the street or in the shop - what is ‘ close contact’ 2 meters 10 meters . With this technology that is available why does every ‘infected’ person not be identified by the system sending not infected persons near that person an alert or similar	2

5745	It's a plain invasion on the privacy of the people, such apps doesn't need to have permission to access bluetooth, phone and gallery or any other related stuff. This kind of application and approach is not good for the people! We are living in a internet based society, you don't need short range connections like bluetooth to be always on, you can access location but not our files this is just an application that drains everyones phone batteries it doesn't even does it's job properly	1

5775	Totally useless and unusable due to incompetent design. There is no registration process offered, or discoverable, only a catch-22 login process. This is basic 101 IT failure. Whatever Minister is responsible should be sacked and the supplier fired and sued. If I was running this contract they would not have got paid a penny for this garbage. The supplier - no doubt an offshore company like Rishi Sunak's in-laws - is defrauding the UK taxpayer and treasury, plain and simple.	1

5785	Motorola 15 mths old no problems. Leave Bluetooth on permanently because also run Fitbit & hearing aid through it. Only 1% drain on battery. Recharge every 1.5 days.	1
5786	Great idea, But, Sadly the app often becomes unresponsive to touches. The UI could have been a bit better, And more minimalistic. And there should be an option to change font size and the font itself, and Dark Mode could've been nice as well. After all, a great app which uses modern technology but sadly it is released too late, and most of the other apps in the world were already using this technology.	0

5819	There are huge privacy and safety concerns because app pretends to be open source and in reality is just a PWA downloaded from government's servers.

5842	It explains thoroughly what it does at the beginning, and then stays out of your way as expected. And our right to privacy is respected!	0
5843	A great idea for Australia. Regardless of efficiency why not have this app open all the time?  If I have been near a person who is Wuhan positive I want to know and I want to know that other people will be told about me. It is a new app and they all need bedding in. Note that every app in the world is constantly refined so give Australia and our Government a break and keep it on!	0
5844	it makes my phone lags horribly causing me to miss many text messages. Very annoying and upset.. if only my company did nt make it mandatory to dwnload i will uninstall it immediately!	2

5859	Good idea, good app. There seems to be some confusion as to what this app does or what it is for. If you leave your Bluetooth on, the app keeps an eye out for other phones whose owners are known to have tested positive. It will then alert you (it will not tell you who they are) so that you can immediately isolate while you wait to see if you develop symptoms or get tested, thereby avoiding passing it on without knowing it. The more people have the app, the better it works.	2

5875	Despite countless feedback about battery consumption since it's inception, nothing has been done to address this problem. Stop wasting people's time by asking for details of our phone's firmware as I do not see anyone addressing the issue of battery drainage till now. Huge disappointment in this programme as well as wasting tax payers money paying for it as problems unsolved for months. If it's not ready, do not force the people into a corner to make it mandatory.	1

5902	The number of people doubting this app is unbelievable! ????. Please run a campaign to clarify (very simply) how it works and clear any (unjustified) privacy concerns.

5906	Now the app is finally fully functional. The ease of check in qr for contact tracing, checkout is fuss free. And easy to keep track of. Even my mum is praising it. Good job!	0
5907	There is nothing wrong with the app. The negative reviews are from people who didn't read that registrations only opened from a certain time. They have now been opened and it works perfectly fine.	1
5908	Not working ???always error error damn it.	2
5909	Well designed	0
5910	Gives you alerts, alright. The rest of the handling, including who to test, when and for how much is different dependent on who you talk to and where you decide to get tested. Too frustrating, this is uninstalled. Use common sense instead of app.	2

5957	5 stars. I'm enjoying the 1* reviews here though, most are either from people who are upset or doesn't let them spy on their neighbours (you have no right to know who has it) or the mind bending "I'm not signing up to that, it tracks my location", like to leave the review saying they you'll have already signed up for Google Play which totally tracks you all the time. Good app, well designed, all depends on high uptake so, like, download it for the win.	0
5958	This app is good, I have one doubt, maybe our personal info can be access by the hackers? Please give us assurance that our personal info is safe. Please reply. Thank you	1
5959	Bluetooth location won't stay on Oppo A2020 and the app doesn't ask for always allowing Bluetooth location access. So when it stops running in the foreground it's particularly useless.	2

5976	Drains to much battery with Bluetooth on all the time. In spite my data privacy concerns, I think it is a good move to improve contact tracing but the app could provide a list of the places, with date and time, where I checked in for my own control. It is already collecting my info so why not allow me to access it?	1
5977	I'm happy with how it works. I'm just worried that only 79k people downloaded it so far. Isn't it mandatory now? Or did I download the wrong app??	0
5978	Started causing a lot of battery drain this weekend and had to un install it. It demands to have bluetooth and location on all the time but that's pointless if you're stuck in the house.	1

5983	Uninstalled the app due to the mandatory SafeEntry check in and out.	2
5984	Like the others, extreme battery draining and overheating the phone, had to uninstall which is against the purpose of this app... Will check again in a few weeks if the issue is fixed	1

5987	As a developing application, this has started okay. It has provided the ministry with Kerry contact details but it doesn’t give the opportunity to link with your national health if, a further improvement or capability. \n\nIt also needs the ability to manually load in details of where you have been so you don’t need to keep separate diaries or paper records. \n\nI actually found it difficult to find a business in our area using the MOH QR image. Many businesses are using other applications and it has become quite confusing how they all work. For this so to be effective, All businesses need to be encouraged to use the one Covid QR coding system and it should be easy to do that.	0
5988	Absolute useless! Ireland is an island... This app should run in conjunction with the Ireland app to be anywhere near useful... The virus doesn't stop at the border!! Ive been using the Ireland app which is brilliant... Sorry but this is a wasted opportunity.	1

6012	The app drain my phone battery. There is no off bluetooth function on the app. I am using a smartwatch which is linked to my phone. If I off the phone bluetooth, I can't use my watch optimally. Please do your logistics proper before rolling your nonsense out. If you can't do a proper app then do not roll it out. If you can't have enough tokens, stop making Trace Together compulsory. Seriously dumb!	1

6014	I received a message from SALT recommending that I download the SwissCovid App. \n\nThe message is VERY poorly written (in English).\n\nThe first line says:\n\n“The FOPH’s SwissCovid app informs you if you have been in close contact with an infected person.”\n\nI missed the “if” the first few times I read it and thought I had been in contact with someone who had tested positive.\n\nThe first line of the message should be rewritten to avoid other people misunderstanding like I did.	1

6029	After installing my battery life had gone bad overnight idle at home easily 35% gone the following day. When outside just merely 4 hrs not even using the phone much drain from 100% down to 60%. I am using Galaxy Note 10 with OneUI 2.5 and Android 10. I temporarily remove the app to check if the battery massive drain stops. I also have a friend using Samsung Note 9 and have the same issue one tome complain about phone getting hot even not using same as I experince I have also.	1

6065	I'd like to suggest a feature that would be very useful and make the app more efficient. Since the app relies on location data users should be able to provide their home address and when they are at that location the app deactivates the Bluetooth search and turns it on when the phone leaves that location. Furthermore, promotion via TV, billboards, newspaper and social media should be initiated so the coverage among the population increase significantly.	0

6201	Great app, would be an eye-opening feature if it displayed how many other individuals (with the app) that you came in contact with during the day. Would also be interesting if the Bluetooth (close contact) feature shared this number of contacts between app users and plotted it on a web graph to further demonstrate how the virus can spread.	0
6202	Good app I love Pakistan	0
6203	Nice	0
6204	Very innovative and privacy preserving approach, however communication could be improved. For example why in addition to keeping active Bluetooth i also need to keep activate Location services. I found the answer (on Android platform detecting proximity with bluetooth always requires enabling location services) but it could be explained in "How it works?" section as well. Another point to highlight to gain more trust is that it was developed as open source effort without anyone getting paid.	0
6205	I keyed in the otp that i received but the apps indicated wrong otp entered. Please help.	2
6206	When i received the OTP to register my phone number, the OTP number was trancated. I have to go to my sms to view the OTP number. However, when I return to the TraceTogether app it led me to the beginning for me to set my phone number again. Very frustrating and i can't register at all. Why this smaller common problem is being overlooked? Very disappointed.	2

6242	Latest update (3 Aug) has possibly caused battery issues. Updated the app yesterday (app now asks for location) and I've noticed today my battery is already below 50% half-way through the day when I normally get to the end of the day with 70-80% remaining. I'll keep monitoring it as Android can just have "battery drain days" so it's hard to say if it's this app's fault at this stage.	1

Make it user friendly. Called 109 several times. Today 08/07 was the first time I've managed to speak to a person. Pls send complaint number and follow up number by SMS.	1

6253	For me the main point of using this app was radius alert but it isn't showing correct records. Few days ago there were lot of pins and now it has changed. its almost changing on daily basis. This need to be fixed as the radius alert was the game changer otherwise there is government website to check for figures and updates.	2

6265	I got a question mark after using for 15 days. Now I reinstalled so many times but every time it shows the same. I can't go anywhere with this app still installed on my phone.	2
6266	Why does the app need to access my camera, files etc? Isn't location and Bluetooth good enough? Seems like you not only want to track our movements but also want to know everything about us. It's an intrusion into our privacy. Whatever spin you are telling us, we just don't buy it. Data security? Well you don't exactly have a good track record on that. Before the election, you said it wasn't mandatory but now that the election is over, you say its mandatory. And you still expect us to believe u	2

6298	For some reason, the battery of my phone is shooting through the roof too. And it happened since sometime last week. It was still tolerable before that although it started to really suck the battery like no tomorrow. And today's the worst. My phone suddenly went flat of battery when I woke up. Usually my phone will still have about 80% battery in the mornings. Last few days it had gone down to below 50% and today is the worst. It went totally flat and I had to wait for the phone to charge from 0	1

6305	Easy to install. This is one way to keep people safe and relax the restrictions so we can get back to some form of normal life. Also protecting front line workers, nurses and doctors.	0
6306	It's a good app. But this is my second time reinstalling it. And the reason why I uninstalled the first time was because of its battery consumption. My phone went from 100 to 10% within 4 hrs.. Is there anyway that the app can be more energy efficient? By the way, I'm using an old phone. Samsung S9. Imagine people using the older phone. Their phone will be drained even faster. I strongly believe this is one of the main reasons why the take-up rate by public is so low.	1

I am 74 yo and my hands are affected by chemoradiotherapy and unsteady. 3 out of 4 of my close friends won't get this app. Too many issues with setting up. No wonder uptake is not as good as you want it to be.Your tech info is sparse for oldies. I'm so disappointed it is no better than months ago. What are " workouts" on a computer. What are " useful Notifications"? You have had time to make everything clearer for us. Pin no Please!	1

6333	Useless. Interferes with bluetooth calls and disconnects the device. Poor quality software. Nice idea and a good attempt but just not good enough. I really tried to tolerate it but no bug fixes forthcoming. Uninstalled.	1
6334	Finding myself and my family much more safer when needing to go out and are worried about 'Covid-19' contact with a possible confirmed stranger...I think the 'Australian Government' has set this platform up very well, in order to keep all Australians Safe even at home. I've read about this App very carefully and it does not in any way breach personal privacy, it works via Blutooth, and all information goes (If you come in contact with Covid-19) does actually go to 'Medical Services'.	2
6335	Why Update notification On Daily basis??? Make A Perfect App Its A Government app make it premium App And need easy Access to everyone. Updated Your Maps/Radius Alert Situation on Hourly Basis. Need A More Work or a professional person to manage it properly .	1
6336	The latest version is definitely improved and more intuitive to use, but I feel there's something wrong with Android version installed in Huawei (Nova3i) Mobile. I see very less count of interactions or sometimes even 0 whereas it shows a drastic difference with my spouse's Mobile which is Samsung S10. Kindly verify this case with your testing devices. Thanks.	2

6340	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful...

While I am concerned about how any data will be used by authorities, that concern is of second importance when it comes to survival of us all. Google and all other apps I use, already know too much about me and yet I don't care as I've got nothing to hide. So let's use this app and let's get back to normal life.

6384	Still killing my battery. Safe Entry that requires scanning totally misses the point. Already killing my battery, might as well scan my Bluetooth instead for safe entry..... No use of exposure api?	1
6385	Mobile number is invalid. I've only had the number for 15 years or so :) Disappointing that there's a glitch. Update: 30 April success at last. If you're having probs registering. Uninstall the app, turn off WiFi, use mobile phone data to download and register the app instead. Make sure you've completed all details and use a zero in front of your Aust registered mob num. That is, first two digits are 04. Good luck Aus, 2.4 mill downloads and counting :)	2

6444	App interrupt with Bluetooth of my phone to connect with other devices. Kindly do not ask for phone brand and firmware. As I have read in the comments a lot of people are having the same issue. This is likely due to the app constant scanning or connecting to other Bluetooth devices that is causing this? Thus interrupting the devices that the phone is suppose to connect. Which are the Bluetooth devices owned by the phone owner. Purpose solution: scan is enough, there is no need to connect.	2
6445	was unable to scan two days ago. did an update but was prompted "Please ensure your google play services is updated before trying again". Am using Samsung note 8. P.S: error is now gone without me doing anything	2

6506	Privacy statement tells you that it does not use your location. Once app installed asks for location services to be turned on with a BS statement about android apps needing location services tp utilise bluetooth. My bluetooth is always on and never with location services turned on. Location sevices being on all the time would also unnecessarily use loads of battery power being on all the time as is required by this app. Immediately uninstalled.	1

6510	Great idea, everyone should use this.	0
6511	Why my android version 4.4.2 is no complaints this version	2
6512	Tried twice to install this app. Got as far as activating, which I presume is using some form of captcha to verify I'm not a bot, and then it fails to activate. A bit like the first app: looks good but useless.	2
6513	Can't even go through the registration process, OTP doesn't come.	2
6514	Great app. Just missing an option to see if I had direct contact during the last 2 weeks with people infected with the virus, or crossed their path.	0
6515	Compulsory and no choice.	0
6516	App doesn't open the nationality scrolling list. Can't sign up	2

6528	I think this app needs a lot of fixes. I took my Covid 19 test at Aster Clinic four days back and the app is stll showing "Not Tested". It should rather say, Tested Awaiting Results.	1

6540	As others have found the App on my Android phone, (Oppo R11S) keeps turning itself off. I have done everything the App asked, have reloaded this App twice so far but nothing changes. The Help desk has not been able to help either!!	1
6541	Happy with it until it repeatedly drained my battery and my phone kept overheating, and the system reported that the Covid app was to blame. I deleted it and the problem stopped. I'm reinstalling it now, but if I have any further problems it's gone for good.	1
6542	I like the simplicity and usability of the app. Hope more features will be added as it shows value.	0
6543	What is questions Mark stands for?	2
6544	Useless app. Drains the battery very fast. Update 22 Oct - My child was forced to install because of school. Built in scanner is pathetic. Had to repeatedly attempt to scan 10+ times before it worked. Drained 25% of battery in 2hrs+. New Samsung Galaxy S20+ with latest firmware still have this issue. Update 23 Oct - Just noticed the app asks for permissions to know precise location and to read contents of storage card. WTH????	1
6545	Keep shutting down by itself initially. I'm using oppo reno2. Realised for it works continuously, I need to turn off the intelligent power saver mode and select the keep running in background for tracetogether in the setting.	2
6546	Too much permission for running in the background required. Location date should be sufficient. Why need bluetooth?	2
6547	Gd	0
6548	After giving all the permissions, I click on a button to activate the app, it tells me I have to input a code for verification and then it hangs there for a minute before kicking me back to the main menu. In its current state, this app is useless.	1

6553	Most of us don't even use Bluetooth.How about getting the location of the patient directly from the sim card.And also Notify if a patient is around 100 meter from one's location.Integrating maps will be useful.That way people can avoid area that has Covid patient	1
6554	Does not open.opens then closes.	2
6555	Easy to install, hopefully we never need it. However feeling safer already. Now we need everyone to install it!!!	0
6556	Aside from the battery drain bump due to Google messing up the play services component, seems to be relative straight forward to use. Would be nice if the national picture and overall number stats provided last 7 day and 14 day versions as the total numbers aren't particularly useful at this stage. Maybe even provide per 100k numbers?	1

6560	Fails to accept a correctly entered phone number. 1st of may and still will not accept my correctly entered mobile number. Time to uninstall as it does not work at all, and it seems no responce or support for the app. Must be developed by human services, they are a bunch of floggs.	2

6583	Keeps crashing	2
6584	Lousy app. Wasting time. Really pathetic that have to install and use for contact tracing. Sometimes must scan multiple times on QR code to detect.	1
6585	Simple, privacy compliant and open source. Several technical hurdles have been overcome, but disinformation and misinformation about tracking is the biggest challenge. Hopefully people will inform themselves from reliable sources and enough people will install it to make it effective.	0
6586	Installed since initial launch, working fine in background untill recent update. Keeps disappearing from background and need to constantly check phone to ensure it is running in background.	2
6587	Was excellent. Now drains my phone twice a day	1
6588	Only works if a person who was diagnosed with C19 passes by. Such people should stay at home, so chance of meeting such person is minimal. Requires keeping your BT on all the time. I rather wear the mask and avoid masses.	0

6633	No point in using this. Except to drain battery with having both Bluetooth and GPS on always. I am not going to spend 75% of my battery to this app every day.

6634	Thia app is good but it have the radius option isn't working	2

6651	I thought only bluetooth is used.. so why is Location also activated? Location is tracking and invading of privacy. News reports say only bluetooth is needed. Why was activation of location not highlighted to us? What is going on? Bad reply to my questions..if you know it's going to be activated, why is it not informed to all? Why hide?	2
6652	Doesn't work with WiFi on. The text says that I should be connected to internet, but I am. If WiFi should be disabled, then this is what should be written.	2

6666	Just discovered the app had been "Auto Disabled" on my android phone. Something to watch out for (When it's running you should get a notification once a week, reminding you and confirming that it is indeed running).	2

6693	observed strange behaviour from this app in the last few hours. devoured battery life and caused the device to heat up noticeably. i've never seen something like that before - uninstalled the app, believing it had been hacked. strange behaviour that warrants investigation.

6747	The app is working fine. Simple and professionally done! Congratulations! But I have a question about the algorithm.Can the app differentiate if someone carries his mobile on his/her body or if it it's located in a bag or the wardrobe box, far away from the user? E.g fitness center, swimming pool etc... I know several people who do not install SWISSCOVID because they are afraid getting false alarms	0
6748	Keep force closed	2
6749	Good app because it is the main app of India to see corona cases.	0
6750	Good and reliable...	0
6751	Great idea in principle but unfortunately of little practical benefit as not every shop or location has a QR code. First time using the app and out of the 5 places I went to yesterday, only one had a QR code. I ended up recording everything in my notepad, but that doesn’t have the advantage of linking in to the contact tracing of the app.\n\nAn easy fix would be to include an ‘add it manually’ option. Search the business or location by address (using address autocomplete that is already active in the app in the personal details section). Include a manual override if the autocomplete doesn’t quite fit. Then a screen to select date and time in time out. It could even be done live with a button to press on entry and exit.\nAlternatively for even easier input, allow location services to locate address, click to confirm, then have the entry and exit buttons to stamp date/time.\n\nAs it stands, it is of very limited use and will only be able to trace a tiny percentage of crowd activity. I buy into the idea and would love to see a more inclusive app... because I want to be contacted if I have been to a place at risk!	1
6752	Very effective	0
6753	Error error everywhere and call centre has no idea how to help	2
6754	The app no longer works on my phone. It repeatedly crashes again and again and again. I guess it was the latest app update that did it.	1
6755	Great initiative and no battery drain so far. For all those people that go on about privacy and it is surveillance and the government tracking people, just have a think. This is installing on a Google phone and Google know far more about you, where you go, places you visit and the speed you go to get there. They know they sites you visit, when you visit and it all links up with your behaviour. This app does not do that. Just a simple Bluetooth register on your phone and upload if you get ask	0
6756	It keeps interfering with my wireless headset.	2

6765	Battery usage has gone crazy over the past day or so. My phone has started flagging constantly about abnormal battery usage attributed to this app, and that I should disable background use.

6779	Good ar	0
6780	1. Integrate with singpass or myInfo to get personal data. \n2. Let app scan for QR code. During scanning also allows Bluetooth to do its work. \n3. Let app detect location or user to select location in advance to prepare for check in, like what Singpass app used to do. \n4. Let user see which location is still checked in so that checking out is easier.	1

6787	App is simple to use and setup however really needs to use the technology developed by Apple & Google to make this app as effective as possible.\n\nPretty sure not using it as there is mention of it or prompts to opt into it...\n\nGiven the situation and probably a whole lot of us installing it now, surprised this isn’t being used...	0
6788	I used this for a bit less than a month. If you have a new phone with large battery and other apps running Bluetooth frequently, and always have icons in your notification area all the time, this app will just be one more of those, and you probably won't mind it. For me who does not use my phone this way, i found it the number one contributor to battery drain and literally the only notification that literally does not go away, regardless of whether you have the app active (bluetooth on).	1
6789	Excellent performance and very useful	0

6797	Your apps is not working? Cant giv 0 star? Why is need to turn on bluetooth that will flat off our battery. After turn on bluetooth it still show "your apps is not working" even multiple exit has been performed. Wasted time. Its the worst QR apps that i have used. Already un-istalled it. Will use IC for entry tracker for some placed that insist of using Tracetogether apps.	2

6882	1. Since installed cannot see Bluetooth devices near me therefore not able to able to connect. iPhone 5s. Intermittent.  2. Writing very light on white therefore difficult to read when reporting issues. 3. Installed it on wife\u2019s phone and app looks different to my iPhone5s, hers iPhone 8.	2
6883	This app was working fine till first if July. Now it shows question mark. I have tried reinstalling several times but no changes. I called the hotline number from 2 weeks and till now noone has bothered to call me back. Regrets. Even 1 star is too much for this inconvenience.	2

6889	Just do it. Download this app if you care about Australia and all of us who occupy Australia. Download!	2
6890	Can we have the app scan the safe entry QR code instead of letting others scan me. Its redundant to have my nric barcode on app when I already have it in my wallet. Preferably I would like to have a very close range bluetooth or nfc where I can tap in & tap out using the app.	2
6891	this apps just louch it, there for this moment its not allowed to sing up . just wait when saudi goverment annoncment for sing up .	2

6893	*edited* Getting better. Keep it up. Thank u.	0
6894	The TraceTogether app drains my battery very quickly since the time I have downloaded it and turned on my Bluetooth for it. So I cannot really use my phone much because of the fast battery draining. So I don't understand the reason why I must download the app name hence I gave it no star.	1
6895	For those complaining about Bluetooth requirements it is a fundamental requirement for how these apps work. In order to detect if you have been within 2 metres of another app user for 15 minutes it needs to use Bluetooth. It is all done in a very privacy friendly way. Look up the details on how it works if you are concerned.	0

6906	Would be nice if it had a built-in QR reader so it can provide my encrypted details when checking-in to restaurants, so I don't have to give them my personal details.	2
6907	Great	0
6908	The app is clearly not working on my phone. If I go into google settings and check to see how many times any app has used the built in covid tracing section of the operating system it states that in the last 14 days the stopcovidni app has accessed my bluetooth keys once. That just happens to be the once that I opened the stopcovidni app two minutes before checking google settings. Obviously each time I close the app it does not continue to run in the background as suggested.	2
6909	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0
6910	After update, app is not opening.	2
6911	I really didnt understand purpose of this app..just booked my tests and got results delivered, thats all? No nearby cases detected? How it keeps u safe then?	1
6912	good	0
6913	This app does not have accurate data regarding case locations, one day it shows cases in 1 city and other day it clears it. Lot cases have been confirmed in Nawabshah, Hala, Shikarpur, Larkana but app does not bother to update it (may be because it is run by federal system!)	2

But the worst is not against the people have built it but is more against our politics (Swiss, European, World) which haven’t agreements to exchange anonymous data about peiple might use same kind as f app in other countries. Switzerland is a small, especially if you stay in a border with other coutries France, Italy, Germany, Austria...	1

6945	this is garbage. there is absolutely no reason to use location for what this thing does. bluetooth is an acceptable privacy breach for the cause, but this is beyond anything reasonable. also, if it's as safe as you claim - publish the sources for what you actually deploy, so we can peer review them. just like us, you have nothing to hide. right?	2

6957	Having issue to obtain otp for huawei device. Please advice.	2
6958	This is completely fraud app. It does not trace at all. All it does is drain battery and shows you are safe. I got infected with COVID. Before that I got near many COVID patients. This app always said that I was safe. Those who created this app should be ashamed of themselves.	0

6996	For some reason after installing this app , i cannot open my bluetooth, edit the information on the app and the app always hangup. Did you study this app or this is a student project or school assignment.. very disappointed	2
6997	It's not working, not allowing the user to sign up or in !!	2
6998	The app has great potential but sadly has very poor utility in that it only alerts you on an ex-post basis of the DATE of possible exposure. Far more useful would be the TIME and the PLACE of possible exposure. Without this information, the app's notifications are of interest only.	2

7009	Ok	0
7010	This app interferes with my bluetooth earbuds. Lots of stuttering sounds and abrupt disconnections. I had to troubleshoot and realized that the earbuds worked fine after uninstalling the app - i guess there's no function to temporarily switch off the app. We use our handphone bluetooth for other purposes too. I hope this can be rectified and improvements needed.	1
7011	Download it and check in everyday -save lives!	0
7012	Badly developed app, consuming too much battery. It's easier to just bring along your phone token, or just cancel your shopping plan.	1
7013	No use Always have to keep on buetooth, which consume more battery.	1
7014	Good	0
7015	Destroys Bluetooth connectivity. The 'Your Phone' app on windows 10 no longer connects. Constantly nags me to connect to my PC. Android 9 on Samsung galaxy S8+	1
7016	Has become a major battery drain. According to Samsung battery usage stats it is responsible for 36% of the battery usage. No choice but to uninstall as it making my phone unusable without carrying an external battery pack.	1
7017	Does not send otp. Cannot set up.	2
7018	Latest up date with a QR scanner but can't even scan any... keep saying not a QR code. Headache using it. Why did you take away to barcode which link to our infor ?

7026	Just open the app and you literally dont have to do anything else. So why are people complaining I dont get it. The information you need regarding how the app works are all online and easy to find. If your battery is draining fast, I suggest a change in phone cause it doesnt affect mine, and mine isnt even the good phones either.	0
7027	ok app	0
7028	very bad application , no have nothing	1
7029	?t's a good app I like it. I had trouble with it at the start, which I realised was the fact that I wasn't putting my series number in, but the last for digits of my tc instead. So it was my mistake not theirs...	0

7034	I using Samsung Note3. This App after updated can't load already. Tried uninstall & install again. The App show : "Your device isn't compatible with this version." People said : is good chance to change the phone. So I buy another phone just for download this App. Cheers. I feedback just to let people know this App can't download or can't loading just because of your phone is too old. But some people said because their is Huawei brands so can not use Google / Appstore. I don't know.. Maybe..	2
7035	Useless, I can not register, waste of time	1
7036	So far it works - but you should offer a TL;DR version of the mandatory introduction (the part of "how the app works", which is very clear for technically inclined people, but could deter some by its length and technicality)	0
7037	Is the covid vacine mandatory or its just some companies in the UAE pass wrong information and force their employees to take it?? In abudabhi musaffa there is a taxi company called (Emirates Taxi), this company sends threatening messeges and forces its drivers to take the vacine yet on the radio the adverts say is volunteering. This company forces drivers to take the vacine so i think the government should intervene in this because employers pass wrong information to employees. Tnx	1
7038	Great idea, done badly. Since installing theres been a massive battery drain on my device, lucky if I get a few hours out of it, highly suspect bad coding causing the app to use Google Services too often Deleted	1
7039	What if you have a phone which can't download IOS/Android????	2
7040	Drain battery and slow on my phone	1
7041	I hope this pandenic will end soon. It drains my phones battery. \ud83d\ude23	1

7043	This app is not working since Monday 29 November 2020.	1
7044	Tryed multiple times to register , unfortunately my mobile number is apparently invalid . Yes i tried full number and dropping the zero. Please rectify this problem. Thanks	2
7045	The app requires permission to access media files and location on my device. I can co relate the reason for location but not media. When only media is declined and location accepted, it does not open and crashes. I guess it needs further development and most importantly, full transparency on its functions to better understand and support its cause.	1
7046	Surprisingly good. Uses bugger all battery, doesn't interfere with other bluetooth devices. The permanent message is annoying but I have that for my smart watch already so I'm used to it.	0
7047	Does exactly what it says, not intrusive, and I have no privacy concerns with it.	0
7048	I found that battery optimization kept turning off in the app I fixed this by going to settings on my phone then battery then energy saver then covidsafe app then turned off all the switches and haven't had a problem since Oh and my phone is an Android phone	1

7080	Why my photo won't appear in the app?	1
7081	I do know my status. No need for app.. Why you don't put Qatar map and see risky areas with conformed cases which we have been? I think the application meaning that?	2
7082	The use of Bluetooth was disruptive in the 1st version: if you were listening to music using a Bluetooth speaker, for instance, there was a 3 to 5 seconds pause every time you were in contact with someone using the same app. Very annoying! This new version has fixed this and the interruption is now very brief, 1 second or a bit less. Congrats to the dev team! I still hit a minor issue: my phone# was rejected when I tried to register. Closing and opening the app fixed the glitch.	1
7083	I know this is important so will keep it but it drains battery excessively. Almost to the point it's unusable. I've had to start carrying a portable charger when I'm out. I think I'm going to have to disable it when I'm at home. I can't carry a portable charger around the house. Ridiculous.	1
7084	Easy to install and register. Do it. Help reduce restrictions, stop the spread and save lives. 1/5/20 update - been using it for almost a week now, no noticeable battery issue, charged my Nokia 4.2 twice this week, as usual.	0

7088	It makes me feel worried when requesting location, although it claimed android needs location turned on for Bluetooth to work. I have downloaded it for quite a few weeks now, but never feel comfortable to fulfill the registration. I don't really trust Google/ android for not collecting data from 3rd party. For financial reason i cannt go for apple. I turned all android & google account location off. I will proceed once the technical issue can be resolved to use Bluetooth without location on.	1
7089	Ok	0
7090	App seems good but my contact tracing always shows a red ! Which indicates it's not working, I've also never gotten an exposure notification (positive or negative) which would suggest it really doesn't work. Good idea but would like to know how to fix the issue	0

7135	Drained my battery completed after being installed for 1 day.... No using having the app if the phone is dead most of the day. Deleted the app.... No thanks. Would not recommend	1
7136	The app drains battery and forces bluetooth and GPS to be turned ON. There is no compatible version for older iOS version i.e. iphone 6 / 6s.	1
7137	The app stores the encounters on the their servers which is a big NO for me. The data should be stored in encrypted format on mobile itself. Only when a person is found positive, the data, through in-app action, should be uploaded to server. At login, the server can send a 'public-key' which mobile uses to encrypt all data. Mobile itself cannot decrypt this data. In Bluetooth com, the key can be sent to the other mobile, and it can send encrypted info to prevent any unsecure clients.	1
7138	While registering Date of birth column is not working......application developer please correct it as soon as possible....	2
7139	Gives invalid credentials message,says my phone number is not registered and to log in with a number I have not seen before	1
7140	Probably an edge case, but I use 2 separate accounts on my phone to keep work/private separate. It works fine for the admin account, but the second user account gets errors and won't allow for scanning. It's annoying because I want to use this, but I can't.	2

7151	Nice app. for locating the infected person.	0
7152	It would be good if the app could alert you to the fact that you have been in close contact with another person to REMIND people about social distancing.	1

7154	Let’s all support this simple but powerful initiative to save lives ????	0
7155	Sham and shame to India's IT competency It simply logs user out and seeks reinstall when you need it most. So many users have reported this. NIC as usual has a outsourced vendor replying standard Cut Paste. Very sorry for this quality for such an important app in the pandemic.	1
7156	Very good idea for an app, this app should be downloaded by everyone here in ireland!	0
7157	Like it but had to uninstall. Was causing the phone screen to go black when making and receiving calls. Sony XA2 Xperia running latest Android.	1
7158	I think this app is useless especially its "Radius Alert" function as I am a Covid 19 positive patient since 7th June with correct current address written on my CNIC but my area shows zero cases	2
7159	I have had the app since it was launched but it has started draining my battery so I regret that I have to uninstall it.	1
7160	Good	0
7161	Extremely bad application. Always not working at all. Why do you keep it in the playstore?!	2
7162	App was fine until yesterday and now killing the battery on the phone. This really needs to be fixed ASAP as either everyone will uninstall the app or will be going around with a dead phone battery defeating the purpose completely. My phone is down to 55% already this morning after 1 hour and its a new phone.	1
7163	Not opening	1
7164	The app has a serious problem. I had gone to visit the ministry of health and the Etheraz app had a (?) Question mark. I tired to re install the app 3 times to check if that would work and I tried calling the hotline number for assitance twice around 11:30am. An automated response says that there are 10 customers waiting and that an agent will get back to you in 2 hours. It has been more than 9 hours and i have still not received a call back. The issue is still not sorted and a bit frustrating.	2
7165	What a joke. The app keeps telling me my session is expired and I have to input my number again to get OTP, and then expired again, rinse and repeat.	2
7166	Good initiative by govt.	0

7172	1 star because I'm forced to download this but for some reason still required to use safeentry and fill up declaration forms. If this doesn't reduce the forms or SafeEntry I have to fill, I don't see the point of the app. Why is DOB and IC issue date required for tracing? Is there a need to check for spoofing? Have people been registering with other IC? I see I see. So you're saying that SafeEntry is ineffective then?	2
7173	This application does not give new coordinates	1

7179	whenever i try to go in it will say its temporarily unavailable like what kind of bs is that	2
7180	It is a need otherwise I would never install this app..the developer is very much aligned to complete a feature rather than thinking about the user..it just sticks on notification pane and shows error via if construct..like if bluetooth is off show error..if location is off show error..

7217	I like the simplicity of the app. Everything is very useful. However it's been draining my battery like a hungry hippo. Just today it already contributed to 34% of the battery usage. Yesterday night I went to sleep with 100% battery. I woke up and the phone was turned off with 0% battery left. I'm using a Samsung Note10+. I check the diagnostics and this app seems to be causing the trouble. So I'm currently 80% sure that I will uninstall this app soon.	1
7218	This app is completely pointless. Mine has to be reinstalled every couple of days after which it will carry out exposure checks for a day or 2 and then completely stop. I could have been in contact with numerous people and had to self isolate but I dont know because the app isn't doing the checks.	2
7219	Ah yes I totally want you to run in the background and drain my battery, and run Bluetooth and drain my battery..... and location services..........	1

7239	Read the privacy policy linked from the App Store page. This app is crucial to SA’s ability to contact trace, and uses world class practices to do that in a way that ensures privacy. Let’s not spread rumours, folks. Now that we’re opening up we need a way to reduce transmission.	2
7240	After the app updated this morning and it ask to verify our NRIC number, name and birth date. Only having problem with the NRIC portion. Keep indicating invalid. Could someone look into this problem, please? Thank you	2

7244	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0

7249	Apple mase an Update on iPhone 5S but yet Apple went beyond and released an update for the iPhone 5s to be compatible with covid alert related apps! Really disapointing.. i don't feel safe at all!	2
7250	App crash whenever SafeEntry check-in is tapped on is fixed for me. The new design is nice. However, would appreciate if the app were to adopt the Apple-Google Exposure Notification API (this setting is now shown as being “not available in your region” in settings).	2
7251	Make it open source and I'll add the fifth star. Using the application a mandatory step to stop the pandemic. By making it open source, you would basically avoid negative comments on data protection and probably get more people to install it.	2

7256	Trying to prove my identity with this app was a nightmare. Whenever I got to the point to upload an image, for sending photo id, to take a photo or upload a video, nothing happened when i tapped the camera icon! Seems certain random aspects of things on PHE/NHS apps don't seem to work on a Huawei P20! In the end i had to complete the registration process using an old SAMSUNG phone! BEyond that, everything seems fine.	2
7257	Just uninstalled due to it disabling itself again so god knows how many times this has happened since the launch. I should not have to manually check all the time if it's enabled for such an important app. I'll rely on people I've been in contact with to tell me themselves cos I'm actually following measures and not coming into contact with anyone.	1

7280	the idea and intiative is very good but it consumes too much battery power and it makes the phone slower. also if i may suggest if there is a map and indicate by location the hotspots in order to avoid going to those areas. additionally, if i am home then turned off the app, the app just keeps on popping on the background and enabling the bluetooth, it says we can only turn on the app while going outside. maybe there will be additional settings for us people to customize the control of this app.	0

7283	Good to have the new qr scan, it cut short 2 steps, and remember the un_checkout location for easy check out. good job! Please add a history or recent for qr scan.

7296	The app drains too much battery! Bluetooth uses the microwave frequency spectrum in the range of 2.4 GHz to 2.4835 GHz, the same as the microwave oven. Can you be sure it's safe for our health in prolonged usage? Telco do have location records which you can track as well. If this App is as good as you claimed, why do you think Safe Entry was created? To complement or compensate this App? Why do you think so little people installed, not to mention those who uninstall right after? Bad experience..	1

7299	For some reason, the battery of my phone is shooting through the roof too. And it happened since sometime last week. It was still tolerable before that although it started to really suck the battery like no tomorrow. And today's the worst. My phone suddenly went flat of battery when I woke up. Usually my phone will still have about 80% battery in the mornings. Last few days it had gone down to below 50% and today is the worst. It went totally flat and I had to wait for the phone to charge from 0	1

7334	Looks like the app is finally working now. I have multiple checks per day that come with a notification. And the daily updates are a nice feature too. Next time you need to ask for consent, you have to send us a notification, nobody opens this app every day.	0

7340	After successfully done the setup, the next time I checked on it, it show "setup is incomplete!". Already done setup a few times, still the same issue	2
7341	This app is a major drain on phone battery and is very disruptive to Bluetooth headphones (cutting connection 2-5 times each track).	1
7342	Please help me understand, my other QR reader able to scan safe entry, but your inapp scanner reply that the same code is not a safe entry code? I have uninstalled, restarted phone, reinstalled, and still same error, why is this trace together app so useless?	2

7364	I have problems last 2-3 weeks, always ask registration when open ehteraz, then exceed activation number, call 109 more than 6 times, follow all recommendation, problem still not solved, can't go to shopping, clinic, mall , mosque, in few weeks need to go back to office , don't know what to do , pls .. pls..fix the problem , or at least don't limit activation number, till problem is solved, I am using samsung galaxy 10, ehteraz is good tool but need to fix the bugs,	2

7373	Unrecomended this app always closed automaticly	2
7374	It's not showing my test results, even if I did the test. Causing a problem, because of this app I didn't receive my results through sms, because I'm registered here and I supposed to see my results on this App.	1
7375	not working	1
7376	i tried to call regarding technical issue but the agent who answed is not for technical problems he told me to call 109 but i already did i think call forwarding is not accurate.. my problem now is I can't access ehteraz due to exceeded activation. please do help me to fix it, for me to access it again on my phone.	1
7377	DO NOT INSTALL, NOT SAFE This is BAD: it actually requires you to have gps on, this is a breach of privacy It is sadly not avoidable because of how Bluetooth works but I really expected more from a government funded project	2
7378	Amazing app.very helpful and informative.	0
7379	Extremely battery-draining because this app requires Mobile-Data or Wifi, plus Bluetooth AND GPS location to be switched on simultaneously at all times, plus it MUST run in the background without limiting its usage of background system resources.	1
7380	No SMS confirmation even when International codes are presented there. Had to cancel travel plans, support not replying either.	2
7381	Good	0
7382	I can not sync my Polar Sport Watch any more over blue tooth since I installed the app. Even force stop the App does not help. Only uninstalling the app makes the sync work again.	2

7386	Great, easy and smooth app!	0
7387	UPDATE: After a response from the support team they have confirmed that the app is still working in the background, despite the "tracking not active" message. This is a known fault and their team is working to resolve. I have checked my Bluetooth & confirm that the app is accessing my Bluetooth log. ----?- App does not appear to be working. I have the app continually running on my phone in the background however when I click on the app it states that "tracking is not active".	0
7388	When i am enter pin messages APIKEY IS NO VALIDE	2
7389	I think there needs to be the option for using non-singapore numbers since there are many foreigners in Singapore.	2
7390	Everyone please download this app!	0
7391	Just monitoring battery consumption but other than that no issues. Waiting for tin foil hatters to leave a review, frankly, to enjoy some nonsense. Maybe a "i am home" button to avoid battery strain would help?	1
7392	Cannot install because my 3 year old phone is not compatible. I wonder how many of the at-risk population such as rhe older people are in the same boat, not having rhe latest and greatest phones. Not going to buy anew phone just to run this app!	2
7393	can't get it to download . all happens is waiting for download but it never does	0
7394	I'm sure it's a great app but I cannot complete the registration process. I left it to now in case they had traffic / capacity problems which would have been understandable. The app returned an invalid number error message each time I input my mobile number this evening - and I have tried more than 20 times - with and without the leading zero! And yes I have had my partner check I didn't get the number wrong. Hopefully a CovidSafe support tech can provide advise/solution. .	0

7399	Dear app developer Please note I'm tested and result was negative. This app showing not tested. Please verify the info.	1
7400	1. This app drains my battery too fast for a daily use. 2. Can someone explain why this app needs an access to my storage? What it has to do with COVID monitoring in Qatar? 3. My phone gets heated up most of the time (i'm not using a very high-end, latest phone model to cope up)	1

7410	I have installed it because I have to for work not because I want to. The fact it drops the Bluetooth connection for other devices like a cars hands free is really annoying and it is killing the battery life of my mobile phone, even though I have a s20 ultra with the improved battery. The app needs a lot of work especially since the government is pushing it big time to the public.	1
7411	Slow down my phone	2

7452	NOTE to those experiencing battery drain, you can FIX this by a) installing this app, b) clearing Google Play Services cache, c) restarting your phone, then d) reinstalling this app. Over the last few days my phone battery was getting slaughtered just like everyone else's; after completing these steps, this app is back to using a fraction of a percent	1
7453	Malware \ud83d\ude02	1
7454	Runs a WebView, so the code is fetched from the servers, how's that for anonymity? Also, what's with all the side 'features' of the app, like health log.	1

7494	App seems to block other Bluetooth connections so cannot connect to headphones, car or speaker	1

7498	It drained my battery, whilst on, my phone does not last a day. Everyone should uninstall it from your phone, if you want your phone to last all day. I'd rather use my phone as it was intended to be used, to send & receive calls. I highly recommend that you either do not download, or uninstall the app. Sorry to say Government, but this app is not good for my phone, and I have a new Samsung S10	1

I did not want to delete it but the apps not going to work if your phone is dead! This needs to be fixed ASAP and assured it won't happen again before ppl can even consider redownloading!	1
7505	It needs to b updated...according to app there's no case in Dheri but cases have been reported there...please chk it However gud idea...gud initiative	2

7516	I agree this App is important for all Australians for the short term. What I did NOT allow was permission to access my location! I was lead to believe that users were not tracked and only Bluetooth required to 'handshake' with others. A friend also installed at the same time using an Apple device but NOT asked to access their location. I'll uninstall until there's clarification and the location requirement is disabled.	0
7517	I can't even get pass the login screen because citizens have to use their pink ic. At least change it to ez-link or student pass man	2
7518	Be some fool to download this app.	1
7519	Drained my battery in half a day. No way I'll keep using it, completely impractical.	1
7520	Hmm not sure about this app. Hate that it has a permanent notification. So annoying and pointless, just run in the background. Won't appear in the app store on my parents phone and they are elderly and need it. Once again, not good enough.	1
7521	To see HES codes, I needed to enter my ID number and other personal details, but at the end I see "there is no match" alert. When I see this problem, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but the problem still continues.	2
7522	Unable to register mobile number. Did not get any OTP message despite clicking on GET OTP numerous times. Very disappointing.	2
7523	Will not accept my mobile number Tried many times	2

7529	Keeps switching itself off without my knowledge or input. Something to do with battery optimisation? Problem is, I don't have that option on my phone active, so why does it keep saying the app is not active?	1

7535	I cant use my phone properly. 1st its overheating even if im not using it. 2nd battery drained so fast and i have to charged my phone most of the time.. please fix this issue.	2
7536	Good	0
7537	I'd like to be able to turn the app off while I'm driving alone in my car as the Bluetooth pings off other people's app and it causes interruption to my music or GPS sounds. I can't turn off the app through Bluetooth as this is how my phone connects to the car. Its irritating in that way.	1
7538	It says "there is something wrong with the connection" yet i have stable internet connection. I even opened my gps and bluetooth.	2
7539	Does not seem to work. Infected contacts not reported in the app.	2
7540	The latest update to this app has caused a problem with the way notifications are displayed on my Pixel 3. If I turn off the COVIDsafe notification then the problem goes away. I will need to keep this notification turned off until this problem is fixed.	1

7546	Fine on my phone... but it doesn't come up at all on the Play Store on my husband's phone and I don't know why?	0
7547	good	0
7548	I cannot login Every time i try its coming "some thing went wrong please try again later" Please solve it	2
7549	Works fine. But why not make it completely anonymous so people with privacy concerns would also download it. Could have easily been an app that gave a unique ID and then sent sent out notifications to other unique id"s that were within range if there was an issue. Unfortunately many people are not downloading this app for this reason. A shame really because it could have really helped if the government listened to those with concerns.	0
7550	Honestly I fear this App doesn't work on certain Phones. I've went day without a check, but my wife who has the same App on a different phone and is constantly by my side has had several checks. I'm beginning to wonder if it's the Phone you have the App download on which receives more that other checks	2
7551	Couldn't make new account. I've clicked the kirim OTP thrice but I didn't receive any message. Now my account is blocked. I am sure my card is still active. Pls fix it, I need it for my flight tomorrow. It's an urgent matter!!	2
7552	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0

7571	Why in the world is push notification required for access, then the app spams the phone with random unrelated pop-ups which serves nothing besides comsuming resources.	1

7586	Update: Lots of Improvement. However, the data transparency portion need improvement. E.g. Allow user to refresh to update the number of contacts made. 1. Interference with other bluetooth devices. 2. No simple data transparency to encourage users. E.g. "Congrats you have maintained social distancing today" 3. No data insights. E.g. a simple bar chart can make us aware of our social distancing effort and make improvement. 4. No option to allow us to turn off when at home.	2
7587	The app and OTP is not sync. 2 to 3 times the OTP is entered right but it says wrong OTP entered. So i am unable to even start to use this app.	2

7603	Installed from early on. Haven't seen any alerts on cases nearby. Why does this app need Bluetooth to be on at all times? Bluetooth uses up more battery life. And notifications are not able to be cleared. Poorly designed app. India has some of the best programmers and yet govt apps and websites are so poorly designed.	1

This app totally violates data privacy policy, as it's grants the government full access to your pictures videos and call logs. I understand GPS permissions for contact tracing COVID-19 potential carriers. But why the app can overcome screen lock? Why do they need to see my storage like appGallery!?	1

7620	Bug identified! This interferes with mobile hotspot and repeatedly causes dropping of signal. Have to turn bluetooth off and therefore disable covid safe to be able to use mobile hotspot function which is how I access internet. Not too bad as I mostly tether at home, but it then relies on me remembering to reenable the app and bluetooth before I go out. May get better usage if that bug is addressed. Hope this helps and thank you to the teams behind this in efforts to keep us all safe!	2

7688	App was fine until yesterday and now killing the battery on the phone. This really needs to be fixed ASAP as either everyone will uninstall the app or will be going around with a dead phone battery defeating the purpose completely. My phone is down to 55% already this morning after 1 hour and its a new phone.	1

7693	The battery drain is unprecedented. If I want to use only safe entry this app doesn't allow, it needs Bluetooth by default. Instead make it optional, if we are running low on battery at least we can make use of safe entry to check in or out. It is all or nothing at present that is one of the reasons people are reluctant to use it and rue about it.	1

But I certainly dont want to be charging my phone 2-3 times a day! Developers can you look into this? As if it continues I will have to uninstall and I'm sure I'm not the only one and more people will follow suit.	1

7782	I had to uninstall. This app was draining my mobile's battery in less than 8 hours. Also the data provided is not useful in telling how the app is helping us to prevent new cases. i. e. . How many people has been advised to isolate because close contact was detected. Irish Tax money was used for this app. I am disappointed.	1

7788	Needs a tweek.. Can a user set the Bluetooth so it works when we leave the house? My phone battery is draining away while I stay home with no visitors. Let us turn it off while at home and activate as we leave and go into public places. If my battery goes flat this fast it will be gone.	1
7789	How does contacting tracing work when there is no information sharing from health agency? This app works on the assumption that when someone has Covid-19 positive result, they would be kind enough to input their result.  If you putting all your effort into each individual using this app to input their result, this app will fail. The government should had allowed information sharing. This app is a waste of resource.	1

7791	This app was easy to use. I had the remove it because it caused my phone to overheat and discharge too quickly.	1
7792	God bless Bahrain	0
7793	Deleted due to overheating my phone and causing the battery to drain. Phone still overheating now due to the effect of the app. Will not be redownloading even when bugs are fixed.	1
7794	After testing the latest update, I have found that it is, at very least, on a technical level, functional.  It still unnecessarily stores user data on a server, uses keys which are not truly anonymous, and transmits your device model publicly.  Once decentralised key exchange replaces the current system, either by an independent update, or by the implementation of the system in production by Apple and Google, I will update this to five stars.  For the time being, I would also like an update so that tracing can be temporary disabled from within the app, without having to revoke it\u2019s permissions or turn off bluetooth entirely, as there is no point leaving tracking enabled when I am separated from my phone.	1
7795	Keeps crashing or stopping unable to use at all	1

7799	Useless app. Keeps telling me my phone number is invalid. Numerous tries. Makes no difference. If it cannot accept a simple phone number I have no interest in why. I expect an easy error free process and have no interest spending any time to fix any of problem this abysmal app needs. Piece of junk.	1
7800	Better	1
7801	I cannot make an account because it says that my IC number is invalid. It does not make sense,how can I IC number be invalid. Please fix your problem.	2
7802	Why is there not integration with Google's exposure notifications?? It means that the app is not constantly looking for other people with CoVID safe. I have also experienced team where I have launched CoVID safe and it was showing off.	1

7806	It worked without issues on an iPhone XS. to those that espouse issues around privacy just remember that your decisions have ramifications beyond just you. If this fails then it\u2019ll fail because people like you are choosing to make it fail. Let me know later if privacy is that important while passing away from COVID because we as a country couldn\u2019t trace the person you caught it from due to oercieved privacy issues.  For those that have highlighted technical issues around the software you are letting perfection be the enemy of fit for purpose. I want this now, not in 4weeks time. I\u2019m not employed by the Federal or State Government's directly or as a contractor. I am an IT guy.	0
7807	No problems installing but it absolutely chews through battery. New S10+ used to last a full day. I head to charge it at midday just to use the rest off the day. Once again down to 40% after only 3 hours.	1

7819	Thank u Bangladesh ..for this app	0
7820	good app	0
7821	If we check in 2 locations in a mall, the app cannot check out the 1st location separately. I must check out the 2nd location, then can go check out the 1st location. Its quite inconvenient.	2

7838	The purpose of the app is good, but it does not display the current number of past and present cases. There are no declared cases by the LGU? I dont think so. Kindly look into this and keep it up developers. We can do this.	1
7839	Simple and straightforward to use. Gives you a rundown of what it will do with your data before you sign up. Good work!	0
7840	Drain battery fast.	1
7841	I support the moi effort to contain the virus but this app is a big mistake. Instead of forcing everyone to download a badly designed app and threaten people with hefty penalty, moi should have tested the app multiple times and get feedback before mandating it prematurely. It slows the phone dramatically and drains battery so quickly. If one can't have the phone active whats the point of this app? I cant pause the app once i get home so it keeps draining battery. No need for access to photos.	0

7844	Works fine with no issues, my original review said it drained battery but after a few days of trying it, I can't see a massive issue especially considering my Bluetooth watch is paired to the phone all day anyway. No excuse to not have the app installed now.	0

7869	Not able to register, for some reason it's just staying still!!!!	2
7870	With the latest update, the app silently deactivate itself as I go about my business during the day. it's like.. it's like it is encouraging me to check my phone every 5 mins as if it's a social media platform or something.	1
7871	Good	0
7872	I installed it just so I could help, but it broke my notification overlay on the lockscreen(S8 Android 9 One UI). I do not mind it running on background, but should have settings to hide or show notifications like all other apps. Very bad UI design, had to uninstall it.	1

7886	This app is so bad and I cannot emphasize that enough. People are dying because of this disease and the developers of this application think it's funny to make a fake tracking app. How is it possible to put a tracker on a virus, it's only a bunch of cells. So disappointed.	1
7887	EDIT: once I turned my VPN off, it was able to send the password and work. Still unhappy with it being a mandatory app however. Have tried multiple times over the past couple of weeks, always says error requesting OTP. Emailed customer service and their mailbox is full, no longer accepting emails. If an app is going to be mandatory and if we will be refused entry to stores without it activated, they need to fix it.	1
7888	I have my updated number as well in eid.but still showing some other number which is not mine...didnt get the covid test result.....always looking for location...if u just want to force as u r asking to do.then why giving option to choose.meaning less.	1
7889	The frequency of interruptions whilst listening to music over Bluetooth is getting ridiculous	2

I searched from google and followed every step it says. Going to setting -> apps -> ehteraz -> clear cache and clear data. Then forcing the app to stop and uninstalling and reinstalling it. All steps are of no use. I've been calling 109 many times but always saying their staff will callback after 2hrs. But no call at all. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude2a	2

7942	I had this app and it was working for like a few weeks, soon as an update for the app comes out, it doesn’t work. I connect Bluetooth, troubleshoot my phone settings to make sure everything is correct on my end. The app still doesn’t “turn on” as it says on the Home Screen. So yah, I don’t know what to tell ya.

7956	Wasting my phone battery...useless App.	1
7957	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0
7958	Nice and clean ui. Easy to use and only keeps data locally. Great job! If you could add a delta on the county total cases daily it would be helpful.	0
7959	Nice app with a good and clear user interface. Hopefully many will download and help to assist NI's contract tracing system. Ignore Jonathan S.'s troll review; this app uses the much more privacy focused decentralised model (compared to centralised model that people may have heard the UK were perusing some months ago). This means means that the data collected is very limited, and in fact, the app clearly lays out and explains what data is and isn't collected up-front. (Note to the developers: I'm not sure how the Google Play store search works, but I found this app very hard to find... In fact, I need to use a direct link. Searching all variations of "StopCOVID NI" only brought back the other HSC "COVIDCare" app, which could easily confuse people looking for this contact tracing app. Given that most downloads will be soon after initial release and announcement, I hope this is fixed soon for the sake of greater uptake.)	0

8003	Clean and simple. Explains clearly what it does and how. Can't say (yet) if it works like it should... But that's not the fault of the app necessarily. One minor nitpick: It'd be nice if the language could be selected in the settings.	0
8004	Can't find any other way to contact the Coronalert team. I have a question: if my phone is sitting for 1h in a locker (e.g. at sports centre) and it catches the phone of a positive case, will the app flag me as a risk or will it somehow "understand" the situation? Why wouldn't the app reveal the WHEN of a potential contamination ? that would enable me to understand at least that it was in those circumstances? And don't tell me the obvious, to turn bt on and off as I will certainly forget...	2

8075	I was able to register fine but my phone keeps crushing if I actually keep the app going. At first I thought the phone broke but as soon as I switch the bluetooth off it works well again. I'm very disappointed as I was looking forward to having this app.	1

8083	I not think is godo	1
8084	Random disruption to my phone's bluetooth transmission to my wireless earbuds and car's audio. My heavy rock bands sound like they drank too much alcohol and are having hiccups while the divas sound like they are intermittently choking on a toad in their throats. Kindly fix the issue.	2
8085	Why this app need a storeg and telephone permission	1
8086	I'm unable to pass the OTP stage. It says "wrong OTP entered" even though I type in exactly what I received via SMS and within the time limit.	2
8087	Keeps crashing after the 27 Oct 2020 update. Please fix it. Old: Still giving the error. It was working good before this udate. Now it shows "Can't run on rooted device" even my device is not rooted. Please fix this issue.	2

8089	Waste of my battery and space. No purpose	1
8090	All of a sudden, I guess through an update it keeps showing covert alert is off. I train people on Apple software so I am not missing anything, I know what I am doing. When I go to the settings everything is on. \n\nPlease fix already!	2
8091	Idea is great. Ui is well organized. But there is nothing helpful. Everyone have to install this app and submit info. Even lots of people not going tell you they have corona. Because some of them even don't go to hospital. About half of the people don't even have an smartphone and 20 to 50% of smartphone users will never know about this app. So it's not going to help.	0

8119	Any way u can make the app internationally available in e store? I know of someone who has spent the last decade overseas, can download singpass and my responder apps, chose to maintain his domicile location as overseas so is unable to download this app. Help?

8129	Seems fine and not much battery drain. However, can't say if it works and if it's efficient since too few people have installed the app. Welcome to the new era where Emocracy rhymes with Trumpidity of the mass.	0
8130	This app absolutely destroyed my phone. The battery only lasts 4 hours after being fully charged. This is a common issue with other people that have downloaded it. They blame the play store but don't want to pay for the damage they did.	1

8138	Doesn't open camera /video despite being given permission. Dev: read the review. The app doesn't open phone camera. No problem registering.	2

8141	Note 10 user here. Noticed that google play store unable to update apps and download new apps (showing "download pending" without moving). After trials and error and even on safe mode, suspect that tracetogether could be the cause. Uninstall and everything works fine. Not sure if i am the only one.	2

8144	History of QR code favourites section all gone after restoring phone. Will be good if favourite places are saved permanently in profile. Easier for senior citizens who are not familiar with smartphone.	2
8145	App seems to have an issue with battery optimisation settings...even when I give the app permission to override and the little notification comes up on my phone saying it's scanning, it disappears eventually and I have to give permission to override again...kind of stupid if I have to constantly make sure the app is scanning	1

8150	Honestly lost faith in the app. I have to check my exposure logs regularly to ensure it's actually checking every 2 hours. I've had days where only a single check has been made by the app. I've also had 3 instances of the exposure logs showing a match but no indication from the app that this has happened or what it means.	2

8160	Finally some clever use of Bluetooth,	2
8161	Useful app, but needs daily prompt/notification if it needs users to check in daily	0
8162	Please update it and then launch it. I have installed but it is totally useless.	0
8163	Is good in theory, but the app ALWAYS drops out, continually have to reopen it, have tried everything, restarting phone, deleting Fitbit app, appears you cannot use this app if use Bluetooth for other devices...	1
8164	Very easy to use and good efficiency	0
8165	The pause function is good if we can customize/set the pause duration to save battery life while we at home. Please also work on making the app workable for Huawei phones without Google services.	2

8182	Trying frm many day bt not working	2
8183	Good navigation. But i dont know whether my registration is complete	0
8184	Had to uninstall it due to the affect it had on my phone, during a phone conversation if my phone connected with any other phones with the app via Bluetooth it would go straight into loud speaker mode and blow my eardrum. The only way to get back to normal was to turn off the Bluetooth, hasn't happened since I uninstall the app.	1
8185	I live with an infected person who is marked in the app for 4 days in a shared apartment, we both have this app installed and Bluetooth turned and so on but I still didn't get any notifications. Also, in the past I got notifications for 10 consecutive days about risky encounters but I was just at my home and didn't meet any people. For me it just doesn't work properly therefore I don't see any real benefits using it.	1

8202	Why would the app as you to switch off the battery optimization! Just relieved that it's for a good cause.	1
8203	Installed easily. As an IT person with a good understanding of cyber security, I am comfortable with using this app in the control of Coronavirus.	0
8204	The app can't confirm the incoming sms, and always notifies that there is no internet connection.	2
8205	Battery drain for Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S9 on most recent updates. I almost bought a new phone until I saw the posts on boards.ie. it could be a Google play issue or covid app issue.	1

8223	Well done ScaleFocus!\nThis idea comes in 2007 by the American Doctor Larry Brilliant who suggested to create a website with similar idea of logging symptoms before/during an epidemic in order to isolate the virus spread. I am glad that Bulgarian company recreated this idea in such a short time. Hope they could give the rights to other countries ao they could use it in the prevention of Covid19.\nThe app is simple and easy to navigate. Hope they could add more features soon, as for example the personal statistics tab where you could see the history of logged symptoms. \nKeep up the good work! ??	0

8241	As someone who works for one of the manufacturers who built this technology into their operating system, this is one of the cleaner and more simple integration of the features I've personally seen.   The explanation about the privacy is excellent, and the app is very stable and doesn't use a lot of resources to run.  The key is to make sure you take your mobile device with you everywhere to get the full benefit.	0

8298	Works well and no real issues running on Mate 9. This is a 3 year old phone, so seems OK on phones that are if this vintage or younger, providing the operating system is kept reasonably up to date. I can't vouch for anything older. I heard that it only works on Android 6 and above. That would mean that phones with operating systems of about 5 years old or older can't run this app. Power consumption is fairly light. Not releasing source code is a minor concern.	0

8300	It really zaps the battery like crazy... coupled with the bt issue that I've read about (which I have not experienced yet). I honestly think this is a fail, am going to uninstall and wait till the product improves and you wonder why the take up rate is less than expected. This is meant to aid in the tracing efforts with minimum inconvenience to the user. Batt and BT, these are the most basic needs of most smart phone users. Please improve on this asap.	1
8301	Notification Was far too late. I knew i was a close contact way before the app told me. Also, I tested positive and my other half, whom I live with, never got a notification.	1

8349	The app is burning through my battery power today, I've had to recharge twice - I can normally go 2 days on a single charge. For a public health perspective I don't want to delete but my phone is useless using battery power at this rate......	1
8350	Not I don't want to sign up. At the "Enter your mobile number" page, there is an error verifying phone number. Network error (such as timeout, interrupted connection or unreachable host) has occurred. there is not even a contact details which I could reach out to contact with such incidents..	2

8356	All very simple and straightforward, no noticeable drain on my battery so far. However, having a permanent notification that the app is running which cannot be dismissed is very annoying, especially for those who like to keep their notifications to a mininum.

After 3hours dead battery Had to factory restore the phone as deleting and uninstalling the app had no effect. WILL I REINSTALL THIS APP ?, as one who installed this app within a few hours of it being released and was keen to do my part to help stop the spread of the virus hmm I won't be as quick this time!	1

8447	A good app which I wholeheartedly support.\n\nIf you login on your phone then install the app on your iPad, it asks you to login on your phone again, and then again on your iPad, which can be annoying if you wish to swap devices. It would be convenient to be able to login on two devices simultaneously.	0

8461	Great idea. Well done. No share option! Fail x 10!!!! I feel like the alert means nothing because it’s under used.  Please consider “sharing” as a big unavoidable button in the centre of the app. Give the job to a hungry startup and it will be done by tomorrow. No time for slow government decision processing this time. Good luck. I hope it spreads faster than fast. We all stand to benefit by widespread adoption. ??	2

8474	I just kindly wanted to ask about the recently update of the ehteraz app. Because in my phone I already updated my ehteraz app in the app store. But when I open my ehteraz its has the note " please update your app". I also try to restart my phone and check again but nothing happens. It's still the same. Is it my phone the problem? What should I do? Some other public place demands the updated app. I already updated my app but My ehteraz doesn't have the "name" . I only have the "time/date".	2

8480	Quick and easy step through process. No issues on sign up. This week 30/6 I have had issues with the app. Updates are not available. I believe in the purpose of this app but it would not benefit users if noone is getting tested regularily. Its the known cases this app checks!!	1
8481	It's probably great but my poor old Android's battery can't handle the strain from running Bluetooth and keeps on switching it off. And, yes, I've checked all the phone settings. Sorry Federal Government. I can't help. Now uninstalled. UPDATE... New phone, now works quietly in the background.	2
8482	What problems i makes not come	1
8483	When I installed this app on my Samsung Galaxy S8, it stopped updating some of my apps and app store stopped downloading new apps. Even after removing it, I had to wipe my phone to get it back to normal.	1
8484	Bug in application. If more than one member in house using the same mobile number, then the application gives the status of Green, instead of Red. It shows my status as Green, even when there are 3 COVID +ve patient diagnosed within 5 days. Initially, it was turned red on the day when I was diagnosed positive and then turned Green when other one for diagnosed positive.	2
8485	Clean the Google Play Store cache if battery is drained by app.	1
8486	Now what happened this app . Showing something went wrong. Please try after sometime........	2

8493	Seems okay. To turn off the constant notification: Settings, Apps, CovidSafe, Notifications. Tap the A to gain control. Set it to the second level. (You can force stop it from here, too, if you want it off to save battery when at home.) To enter your phone number, leave out the initial 0. I don't understand why it wants location permissions, but it seems to be happy with location services turned off. NB: I have a 2016 Google Nexus that no longer gets updates, so yours may be a bit different.	0

8544	Contact tracing section keeps turning covid app off. All phone settings are correctly switched on but unfortunatly this part of the app has a mind of its own. Useless app for me unfortunately.	1
8545	I have an Apple iPhone X running iOS 13.4.1,  I downloaded the app from from the App Store and installed without any problems at all.  There is a small glitch which is after you enter your mobile phone number, as well as the \u2018continue\u2019 button the \u2018verily phone number\u2019 text was also showing, however the \u2018continue\u2019 was much more obvious and when pressed I received my PIN number immediately.  As the app has +61 there is no need to enter the first zero of your phon number.  We all need to be even more aware of safe actions and behaviours now some restrictions are being eased.  So please install the app and use it.  To all those who flocked to Bondi and other beaches against instructions did you know the Governor of New York has said the major reason New York as such a massive death toll compared to San Francisco and Los Angeles is that New York introduced lock-down and social distancing 1 week later.  Only 1 week made a difference of thousands of deaths, so please use the app, follow the rules and was your hands (properly) with soap and water.     May we all emerge safe and well, however we must all do the right thing.	0

8560	Since for a week I checked often this app no matter where I go in Zurich region. There is no warning, no updates of the regions where possibly had COVID-19 before. What is the point of this tracing map?! Radios /TV news update muscle faster.	1
8561	Nice simple app, would encourage as many as possible to use. Using phone number is optional. Location is used to gather data to spot clusters. It isn't private data. Only downside is you need a phone that's iPhone 6/android 7, which may inhibit people with older mobile devices.	0
8562	If it saves lives, it's worth it.	0
8563	Cant registered, app have error temporarily unavailable. Please help to fix this issue	2
8564	You need to enable the location or the app does not work! This means that you can't use the app and prevent other apps or Google to track your precise locations. It may be true that the app does not use the locations, but the only way to have it working is allowing all the other apps and Google to track your locations. This is a grave loophole. I normally don't want apps to track me all the time, so I can't use this app. Please,inform user correctly!	2

8606	As a developer I didn’t find any helpful feature in this app and also I can say that like this app there are so many Covid19 tracing open source app on GitHub any entry level developer can make this type of app within 24 hours.

8620	Drains the battery without providing any helpful information	1
8621	Very good initiative. Both GPS & Bluetooth are used as feature phones don't have GPS. If possible, please ensure automatic instalation in each & every cell phone by sending a link to all numbers and announce its mandatory to install for coming out from home. Best wishes.	0
8622	Do not bother installing this app. Newspaper claimed 1m users installed it when numbers were 100k. It's anti-human and unconstitutional. Virus that has death rate lower than seasonal flu does not need an up. Who needs this app? Ask this question. Why there are no apps to stop drink driving in pubs? Get notified if person who was in a pub is now driving a car? Why no apps of pedophiles to protect your children from those who had convictions before? I am deleting this app to protect my pravicy.	1

8643	The app is crashing after 8.0.0 version update. Crashing instantly. Please fix it. ASAP	2
8644	On s20 ultra need to restart the app if your phone battery died on you by overuse as it doesn't start automatically when you run out of juice mostly when I'm streaming videos. Took a star off due to the generic email response from customer service	2

8648	Dont know why need to input NRIC Date of issue... it is one of the madatory field if you want to reset SingPass password.	2
8649	Draining my battery, I'm seriously considering uninstalling this app, I can be left without battery at an instant, it's a disaster. Fix it or its purpose will be defeated.	1
8650	Two days in a row the app tells me I am in "higher risk" and says I've been in contact with 4 people. That is just not possible as I have not left my house thus certainly not been in contact (less than 2 meters for 15 minutes) with anyone infected. Please review the range check of the app.	2
8651	Its disrupting my Bluetooth earpiece	2
8652	Really amazing and wonderful App	0
8653	Nice black theme implementation, I like it! Some of the preliminary text could be condensed and the full counterparts moved into menus though, currently it's long and tedious to read through. Once you're past that, the interface looks intuitive though. Good work!	0

8660	I've read 42+ reviews of people receiving an Invalid Phone Number error. One mentioned problems if registering before 6pm. One mentioned needing to "waiting a while". One mentioned it took several attempts. None of these apply to me, and I still get the error. My 9 digit phone number is definitely valid. You can only enter 9 digits anyway so don't enter a leading zero. Ensure not in flight mode. The app installed fine on my partners identical phone. I assume the computer boffins will be reading this & getting an update out as soon as possible! My partner is still waiting for the 6 digit PIN after 15 minutes. Server overload? Sounds like the last IBM census. 2 days later - still waiting for a fix...	2
8661	Politically motivated addition of case numbers - totals rather than active, and no actionable breakdown. Still relying on sub-optimal homegrown solution rather than leverage Google/Apple platform. No data so prove that it actually delivers any benefit	1

8668	Drains battery. Phone now only lasts 8 hours with minimal use	1
8669	Useless. Uninstalled. I'll reinstall when you make this far more sensitive to be captured. 15 minutes at 1.5m? No wonder you're not getting any information manual tracing doesn't already do. Waste of millions of dollars if you keep it at this level. Sort it out.	1
8670	I don't understand the use of this app, when i came in contact with a covid +ve person, the app alerts after 5-10 days, fayeda kya hai is app ka bhai, jab ye immediately alert nahi kar sakta?	1
8671	Great concept app but heats up phone and battery killer after latest update.	1
8672	thank you qatar for doing your very best for keeping us safe...keep it up	0
8673	Sorry, but this app is rubbish, each time I use the app it says please update. I try to update, then my phone says insufficient space, please remove other apps. When I finally get on to ordering my prescription, I then find that some of my drugs are missed off, so I have to write them in notes. Finally when my drugs are ready at the pharmacy, the drugs not officially listed are missing.	1

8675	app operation overly strictive, as i can't use just only the scanner and leave the rest for the token to tank.	2

8677	Wow this app is very helpful in this covid 19 pandemic Keep it up	0
8678	Can't even download.	2
8679	Awesome	0
8680	This app was a great idea, but could have done with some more background work before launching. It has been responsible for so many people's phones crashing. So everyone keep away from this app. Unless you have plenty of money to spend on getting a new phone or phone repaired. It also lacks information on daily new cases and county break down.	1

8696	After installing it I realise that it affected my wireless bluetooth earbuds. The sound seems to have become weaker. In addition, it really drain my phone battery, thus I have uninstalled it. Please improve on these 2 points.	2
8697	Sooooo good and helpful for our health conditions	0
8698	It doesn't work	1
8699	non stop crashing	1
8700	Easy to set up, but for some reason the exposure logging is stuck on "active for 13 of the past 14 days" for a few days now. Didn't it log the last few days or what's happening? (Is fixe now) Also it only updates once a day during the early morning, wouldn't multiple updates a day be better for a quick response time?	2
8701	After installing the last update, the app keeps crashing. Pls fix.	2
8702	The app is user friendly, with information thats up to date. But if u allow the contact tracing to be enabled, it drains the life out of the battery!This didn't happen for about the first 2 weeks I had it, a recent issue. Developers, please fix this.	0
8703	best	0
8704	Very good	0
8705	Has anyone got notified by this app? What was described is a really good ideology, You dont know whats going on beyhond the wall. Yet, the app is piece of **. Drains battery, no optmization tech, Poor design and many more. It would be better if covid check-in services would have been deployed on the app.	2
8706	Battery drain issue is unworkable. Alert us when fixed!	1
8707	Since the newest update, I have been experiencing interference with my other bluetooth devices. The connection has been affected and may even lose connection occasionally. Kindly fix this issue.	2
8708	Testing of this APP shows flaws. It will respond with "invalid phone number" if for whatever reason you need to register again. Simply deleting the cache causes the APP to fail. Only solution is to uninstal and download again. On one phone tested the APP looked like it was working but there was no Bluetooth activity so it was not. Something happened to the APP over night. The APP records every other phone with this APP installed, meters away through walls and in other apartments. I could go on	1

8729	I am outside qatar, i am travelling soon. It shows connection error while registration, is there any such criteria? that it wont work outside country.	2

8757	My main concern is Is the battery life. The phone doesn't survive the whole day when Bluetooth is always on. Other issue is I believe it is interfering with other Bluetooth connected devices such as my fitness watch. I always having issues connecting to it after installing this app. Most of the time i have to restart the phone.. :/ QR code scanning also had some issues. However i received an update to the app. Need to monitor and see.	1

8773	Working fine. A great tool track the contact of covid 19.	0
8774	Helpful app	0
8775	This is a great idea to trace out contacts. But it probably work ,when maximum parentage of the population were checked out their RT-PCR and when the greater number ( seems 95%) of the population using an android device. Otherwise it can't helpful.	0
8776	Bluetooth/BTLE technology was not designed as used by the app designers. No coordination with OS vendor Google. Very inefficient design and low compatibility to wide range of Android OS devices . Security and safety has yet to be proven for the app as it has not been peer reviewed by non-Singapore based Security researchers for infosec purposes .	2

8794	Helping my husband (army regular) to download and register the app. App requested for NRIC date of issue for completion of registration. Army guys do not have NRIC with them so it's puzzling why this piece of information is critical for registration. Thumbs down. Update: Yes, of course I read that part. Why make it extra harder for NS servicemen to download and start using this app? If this piece of information is not critical, why request for such information??	2

8825	This is new way to make money from the people, because of this application almost people have to buy the new phone,	1
8826	To all the people saying that they don't want to be 'tracked', that is just ridiculous. For one, you are already being tracked far more by services such as Facebook, Google, Instagram and via your SIM card. These companies legally have to forfeit data via a court order, so if you don't want to be tracked you will need to get rid of any piece of technology that uses internet. Not even a court order can release the data gathered by this app! If you want restrictions eased quicker, use this app.	1

8846	3 people in my house have been using this app from when it was released. 2 of them tested positive and inputted their test results into the app however after more than 24 hours I haven't received an exposure warning on my app?	2
8847	Installation steps lacked help when invalid number occurred. Needed to search for a solution after many unsuccessful tries. Turns out that WiFi needed to be off.	2
8848	I literally have to have the app open, on the screen, for it to be active now, I don't have the option to give it location access all the time	2
8849	Just get the damn app. Privacy policy and stuff seems pretty good. You can technically sign up with whatever name you want which is a win.	1
8850	Best experience with the app. Keeps all the data and share if you are in contact with the Covid person. Keep a good track.	0

8887	Battery vampire, demanding bluetooth be on! And also invasion of your privacy till the point that you might as well sell your personal life to the CCP	1
8888	Terrible interface, horrible app optimisation and saps a ton of RAM.	2
8889	Good efforts But it should be modified 1 .Specially map (it should look google sateelite map ) 2. No of confirmed cases in the effected areas should be written . 3. Cases are increasing day by day but map is showing same status as previous week also not showing no of cases in particular area . Like in Hyderabad more than 400 cases but map show only two cases !!	0
8890	Good	0
8891	Over the last 2 weeks the app keeps crashing several times a day. This will stop it doing it's job if you come into contact with a known case when the app isn't functioning. The only way i can see it has crashed is by looking at the screen. No sound happens when it crashes.	1

8920	This an excellent app, especially to be aware of the current happenings and to stay away from fake news. You can improve this app by making a simple online test for the citizens and residents to clear their doubts ( whether they have covid-19 or not as some people regularly catch cold or fever ). This may be useful to clear misunderstandings.	0

Then you can turn off your Bluetooth & Location. You don't need to turn it off while you are outside of your house. This is mandatory, to warn you from person with Covid 19 positive around you.	0

9013	Dear developer. Thanks for your response. I'm using Samsung S10+. With this app, the battery only last me 6/7 hours of a day. My work requires me extensive use of the phone. Hence, I have to carry a battery pack with me wherever I go. As my phone ages, I'm sure the battery power will drain much faster. There is no point for this app if users phone batteries cannot last the whole time that they are out and about. Not sure about the privacy portion....	1
9014	Block off/Disabled all my other bluetooth devices	2

9020	Good app - nice design, loads quickly and I couldn’t find any bugs \n\nSome minor issues/suggestions: it would be nice if it integrated with password managers and also if you could verify via phone rather than email. It might also be nice to have the option to not delete everything after 30 days. And if you could make the code open source that would be awesome	0

Over and over again. After what must be well over one hundred attempts to register, it's time to uninstall.	1

9079	this application are not useful our daly life	1
9080	It keeps closing...not very useful when I get home and realise it hasn't been tracking. I make sure I reopen the app every morning but it closes within a couple hours. I have selected the not allowed option within battery optimisation, so it's not due to that. Update: newer updates have fixed this issue	1
9081	It is very important to support the users in times of difficulty and this App's support team did not reach even the normal standard of customer service. Very low response and technical assistance. I hope that there will be a better (app) option to protect myself and others from COVID-19.	1
9082	Ridiculous battery usage recently, I have to disable to have a usable phone	1
9083	A great app! Well built and completely anonymous. I hope enough people will install it. Kudos to Belgium for this!	0
9084	All good but enough already with the motivational and self-aggrandising messages it continuously and continuously sends out. I had to turn notifications off to shut the thing up. That probably means I won\u2019t get a notification if I come close to a risky patient. Doh!	1

9097	A breakdown in numbers per town would sharpen attention. The app is more like a screenshot of a Web page - nothing very illuminating. How often has the contact tracing element been used? Battery draining was a real problem. Reinstalled now. Let's see.	1
9098	Government thank you so much	0
9099	Good	0
9100	Great idea. But it interferes with my earphones and car system. So I use it only when I don't use bluetooth for anything else and when I remember to a enable bluetooth in covid safe app.	0
9101	I think this app is a brilliant idea so long as many people use it. I am 12 years of age and have an underlying condition. Its a rare condition and i am not sure if i am considered vulnerable or not. Because of this i am being as careful as possible. The minute i heard the app was launched i downloaded it but sadly it said that i am too young to use it. Just because i am under 16 it will not let me use the app. Government please reconsider this as people of all ages have underlying conditions.	0
9102	Easy to install, easy to register. If it help us get back to normal quicker, I'm all for it. They are very clear as to how the data is kept and when it will be accessed	0
9103	Wow so many idiots reviewing this app.. just turn it on, unselect your notifications in the settings you stupid numpties.. bluetooth isn't using any extra battery, I've noticed no difference.. go put your tin foil hat back on and enjoy the restrictions..	1

9114	You should show the active cases how are we supposed to protect ourselves without that. Its critical for the safety of the vulnerable people . This is the only way we can have an understanding of the whole situation. Without the no of cases in an area it gives a false sense of relief. Its better to be safe than being concerned about privacy !	2

Moving through apps was slower than normal.Some apps would not open or freeze on the screen. Found bluetooth connections with other devices also impossible, had to restart phone every time to fix it. Once deleted most if not all functional operation has returned on first day. Not happy needs work here to re-instal	1

9156	The app launches slowly (takes more than 5 seconds) and uses a lot of background RAM (>1GB) and slows down my phone a lot. While running in the background, it keeps crashing. If you're going to mandate the use of TraceTogether, pls make this app more usable.	2

9316	Suck battery life faster than PAP suck erp money.	1
9317	Get it running people and join the community to fight against the virus. Taiwan and Singapore has been doing this for a long while, especially Taiwan and no one there is complaining about invasion to privacy while they have the virus all under control.

9324	why i cant see my health. only question mark	2
9325	I dont understand how it works???	1
9326	Was running fine for months then, I'm thinking at last update, it kept turning my Location on and draining my battery. I looked into the app and it is not active due to Location turned off. Before I only had to have "Location Permission" turned on for this app... Not the overall location. Not going to turn the Loaction on. I will just leave it inactive. These systems won't work if they're not usable.	1
9327	Easy to use. Then again, nothing much happened yet.	0
9328	If you get the invalid number message just turn off your WiFi, it seems to work that way. Hoping this gets fixed asap as it will stop many people from registering.	2

9331	Hi. This trace together app can not assessible in Huawei mobile phones. I have bought and then only I have noticed that this application is incompatible to that phone. I have checked with the shopper. But they directed me towards customer service. But still not received any news.. kindly advice me that where can I go and complaint on this issue. Or any other ongoing processes to resolve the issue. Otherwise the government have to cease all the Huawei phones sales which is not assess the GOV.sg application untill resolve this issue.which can help the people those unknowingly purchase these phones	2
9332	The app is not working. First it showed 403 forbidden. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled, now it's stuck on the register page, says "There is some error logging you in". Please help.	2

9340	Triple Useless. A person with Covid-19 has to be tested positive (it's almost impossible to get tested in Japan). Then they have to use the app, register their positive status, keep their phone with them and keep the app running at all times (impractical). Finally, "contact" only counts if you're within 1 meter of such a person for at least 15 minutes at one time (an absurdly narrow definition of risk).	2
9341	I think it's important app to have it in this current situation. But whenever am trying to register pop up coming as "Unfortunately Ehteraz has stopped".sometimes it's going to another page where I put mobile number,ID number n exp but after tat when I put OTP it's showing "Error in registering ". Till now I uninstall n again installed more than 10 times. Checked settings of my mobile. How to fix this issue?	0

9356	Was not able to use the app on mobile data, previously was ok. Using HW P20. Pls advice.	2
9357	There should have explanation in the update of the following: The color of the logo has changed from blue to red. It requires more information such as NRIC. Name, etc. I am not comfortable to provide the additional info without clear reason, which was not required in the first version.	2
9358	Good app	0
9359	Nice idea but app keeps closing itself. I got rid of the app because I am worried that government messes up data. My daughter got tested for Corona and they messed up test and thanks to that we had to self isolate for one week.	0
9360	App says it "is active" and therefore should be working fine, however for the past 3 days plus today, it also states in the history tab that I have had zero exchanges with other people, which cannot be correct? Please investigate whether last update affected proper functioning as the app will be useless if so. Thanks.	2

9373	Good	0
9374	UPDATE: You can turn this app off and on! To turn off: Settings->Apps->CovidSafe->Force Stop->Ok To turn it on again before you go out: Start app like any other. Hanging out for the source code. Sampling theory suggests it only needs to check once every minute and record a contact if it can ping the othe phone 14 times in 15 minutes Original Review: A real battery hog. I want to be able to shut it down when I'm at home. Also having a lot of trouble with my Fitbit app when this running.	1

9463	Disrupts my bluetooth earphone connection, no more disconnecting once I uninstalled it.	2
9464	No phone or battery issues on my samsung a5. Would like to see time shortened from 15 minutes to 1 or 2 minutes and warn me when I'm close to someone would be much better so I can move away. Otherwise it's fine. Can't see the point of having it if it waits 15 minutes to say I've been close to someone that's not good.	1
9465	Doesnt drain my battery, everyone having a sook, I have a galaxy s10. Works fine. Doesn't drain the battery, and in fact I barely notice the app is there at all. Same data sharing as social media, so no brainer guys.	0
9466	Showing question mark	2
9467	Is this app working? Every time I click into the app it says its not active.	2
9468	Proud of our Singapore Govt that has taken every measures to protects us from this Covid-19.	0
9469	Together we can do this. Please share it to everyone!	0
9470	This app occasionally cuts off Bluetooth devices when it is enabled. It gets annoying very quickly. Occasionally embarrasses you when the music on your phone speaker suddenly plays aloud after temporary disconnect.	2
9471	Power hungry. Flattens battery in several hours.	1
9472	Ridiculous app can't even register myself, telling me my nric is wrong? Thats the only one i got thouggh	2
9473	V goood	0
9474	Nice	0
9475	Worst app always adk to enable Bluetooth and consume alot of battery	1
9476	After installing the new app and delete the old app the new app don't recognize my nric no. Is weird and cannot log in why???	2
9477	If there is a chance the app can save lives it's worth the bugs. Yes it compromises other Bluetooth connections and battery usage slightly increases, but both are preferable to death. And to those concerned about 'giving away' your location; you gave that away when you bought a mobile phone.	1
9478	Had a to re-login but the password no longer works...  The reset password system also never arrives so guess I’ll have to set up myself under another email address.	2

9485	Very bad app no good information and not take care	1
9486	I hope the Devs can fix the issue with this app killing Bluetooth headsets, I need my Bluetooth headset working as I'm on the phone for hours per day. Maybe even a pause button if the headset wireless issues can't be fixed.	1
9487	Invasion of privacy	1
9488	The app keeps stopping after latest update. Please fix this :(	2
9489	Garbage	1
9490	nice	0
9491	Im unable to login It saws there is some error logging for you	2
9492	Tracing doesn't need Ads. Constantly updating.	2
9493	I downloaded the app because I want to help. However, it’s been draining my battery like crazy. The stats from the battery app testify to this fact. You need to fix this ASAP otherwise I’ll have to uninstall, which I don’t want to, as I think this app is key in fighting COVID-19.	1
9494	User-friendly and no battery drain. I didn't have to use the QR code function yet. So much better than the french one lol.	0
9495	People download Facebook and Google without a second thought but wont download this. Location request is only for bluetooth program to work and does not track your location. Does not use your gps. Great idea. Please download so we can be free sooner.	2
9496	Good	0
9497	The app has "network issues" even when I have working wifi and mobile data. Pls fix this. I can't even get an OTP because the app is incapable of detecting an internet connection	2
9498	Having issues to register after reinstalling keep saying there is error in the format of my name and nric	2
9499	Very good	0
9500	Does it really detect anything on a real time basis. I doubt !	1
9501	Massive battery drain and Bluetooth issues made phone unusable. Great idea, poor coding. If the Government wants this app to do it's job, then don't let a 2 yr old do the encoding. Tried on 2 different handsets from different brands. Issues same across both devices. Want more Australians to use it? Then fix the damn bugs. I will not be reinstalling for a third time until issues are fixed.	1

9512	What's the point of the app when I can't even sign up? Requested otp for 3 times..	2
9513	Very bad	1
9514	A good starting point but need more localized information ie clusters & places to avoid! Also phone verification is a must to stop pranksters.as others have pointed out needs a daily reminder to check in say at midday as it could easily be forgotten. will rate it a lot higher if these updates are applied.	0
9515	TURN OFF WiFi or you will be told your phone no. is invalid and the app wont register. This app would not accept my mobile with or without the leading 0. Tried 4 times and told every time my number is not valid. This was attempted 24 hrs after registrations were enabled. My wife tried same app with same result. Searched WEB to find people saying "Turn OFF WiFi" and it worked. GOVT & THE APP DEVELOPER SHOULD MAKE THIS NO WiFi REQUIREMENT CLEARER. Bad experience likely to affect app uptake	2
9516	I can't able to log in. I deleted the app cache memory and clear data and uninstalled Aarogya setu app and installed it again but it still shows error in logging in.	2

9520	I have a question my dad is not a smartphone user so he can't have this app what to do	2
9521	This is draining battery because it's tracking more than covid symptoms. Its reading everything in your phone. Spyware.	1
9522	Very fast useful	0
9523	This new update keep makes my app crash and force closed. I've tried restarting my device 3x times already now and no budge.	2
9524	Extra star if this app would say how many downloads or subscribers it has. THE PUBLIC WANTS TO KNOW!	2
9525	You need to enable the location or the app does not work! This means that you can't use the app and prevent other apps or Google to track your precise locations. It may be true that the app does not use the locations, but the only way to have it working is allowing all the other apps and Google to track your locations. This is a grave loophole. I normally don't want apps to track me all the time, so I can't use this app. Please,inform user correctly!	1
9526	good	0
9527	Very badly designed. As soon as I installed it, my battery drained. Kept doing this for a few days until I un-installed it. Good idea, badly executed!	0
9528	It's going to work less day by day. Need improve and update.	2
9529	Worst app ever! Doesn't even open after downloading. Ridiculous!	1
9530	Great idea to get things back to normal faster. Besides Facebook. Google. Siri. Etc etc And most of our apps know much much more information about us than then basic app. Note. \ud83d\udd0b battery optimisation is off as needs to run in your pocket when you're not using your phone. It does this for you on setup and tells you. Some people get annoyed but it's needed	0
9531	Has only found ONE contact I believe. It's rubbish.	1
9532	The problem with the recent update is that I can't use this app as a Singaporean citizen and I'm a student	1
9533	Invalid phone number. Won't accept	2

9578	Great idea put it on your phone's save lives	0
9579	Update: After installing the app again on August 11th, it appears to be back working and stable again. Excessive battery drain resolved. Since August 8th this app and Google Play Services are chewing up battery! I'm going to have to uninstall it, I'm losing a percent of battery every 3-4 minutes. The battery usage apps overview shows both this app and Google Play Services (which is tied to the app) as being the biggest battery offenders, using over 45% of the battery in the past 24 hours.	1
9580	no issue, just the standard COVID app that use google service which anonymously share a unique UID which is deleted 14 days later. for the conspirationist : no it's not a limitation of your liberty ... and no they are not spying on you ... they don't give a flying F about you. but if you are positive, i register you as a "paranoid bioterrorist" nothing to hide, specially if i was COVID positive i would gladly register to the app as such and protect other users of the app,	0

9584	Great app to keep everyone safe. A must have for everyone using Android. It should have been part of the OS tbh.	0
9585	Failed to register my details because of 'Invalid phone number'. Why ? People call me on this number and it works. I tried 2 number formats - without and with leading 0. Both failed.	2
9586	App suddenly causing massive battery drain. Depleted from 90-100% down to 10% within 3 hours numerous times within one day. Leaving 1 star review in the hope that this gains visibility.	1
9587	Though the app has relevant information, however it would be better to include graphs and pie charts showing various stats. This would enhance the interest of the user. Moreover, additional links to various stats should also be created i.e age group, male, female etc.	2
9588	Definitely much better after the updates. New features included the numbers of Bluetooth connections made a day and SafeEntry scanning function too. Would be good if it allows us to save/favourite locations (such as MRT/Work places) that we frequent so that it will be more convenient for users to check in and out of places.	0
9589	The app worked fine for 14 days straight, then gave an error (something to do with an sqlite database query not being successfully executed). The app kept crashing and I had to uninstall and re-install it. This means I lost all my Exposure records? Giving a 3/5 just because the rating is required.	2
9590	Too resource demanding from my phone. Battery drains much quicker and bluetooth connections stutter constantly. Please download it because better safe than sorry.	1
9591	Nice	0
9592	A complete violation of privacy that isn't optimized at all. So if I don't allow the government access to thing sthey shouldn't need to see I can be fined? Orwell would be proud.	1
9593	I feel that the app should not require QID to register cause thousands have lost the jobs with their RPs expired but they are still here. The idea is to have as much as possible number of people to have this app in order for all to be more protected. please remove the QID requirement, or at least the expiry date	2

9637	Why my Ehteras always stoping	2
9638	You mustn\u2019t have tested this real well. It tells you there\u2019s an error when you try to put your mobile number in. Also a lot of people won\u2019t know how to enter there phone number without the 0. Confusing . I couldn\u2019t set it up successfully . Disgraceful that such an important ap has not been tested properly	2
9639	Whilst it may help keep us safe it does seem to be at the cost of hogging your bluetooth so nothing else will connect properly. As an essential worker I'm traveling into the city every day(a 2 hr trip) and this app means I can't listen to music. If I'm in the car the connection keeps dropping meaning I can't receive calls if I must. The only reason this doesn't get 1 start is that I appreciate it is to try and keep us safe.	1

9655	I think the app should notify the user (maybe it already does) if he or she installs it, but somehow forgets or skips the setup (Bluetooth and running in the background). It actually happened to me. I opened the app a few hours later to discover that I needed to go through the setup, which was "hidden" behind the 'Help' button.	1
9656	Great initiative by the govt. If you like the govt or not it's your pov. But this app helps in contact tracing and will keep us alive. People who are too concerned about privacy issues, stop using all the social media and then talk about privacy.	0
9657	Good	0
9658	It says my mobile no. is invalid. It also says my husband's mobile no. is invalid as well. How many others are experiencing the same problem.	2

9663	Got test results 4 days ago, app still says test results unavailable. How can I manually fix it ?	2
9664	Had problem singing up but that was fixed in later updates. Although the app is good i dont see any info related to tracking. Atleast show users travel history map. I know its being recorded than why not show as well. In addition the app should be able to automatically turn on bluetooth/wifi once permissions are given. Not sure why you keep asking the user every single time	2
9665	Mind fixing your OTP nonsense? Encourage singaporean to download this app yet the OTP won't arrive? What's the point of encouraging us to install this app then?	2
9666	Want phase 3? Better download this app and show to big brother.	1

9675	The app is draining my battery at a rate that is unexpected. I usually make it through the day using around 67% by the time I recharge at 10 pm. I have had to plug the phone in at around 1pm as it's totally flat......... perhaps you can work on this.	1
9676	Love the idea of the app and it's potential usefulness, and have used it since the beginning. The last update seems to destroy battery life. I've put up with the Bluetooth glitches, but can't live with the reduced battery. Have had to uninstall until fixed.	1
9677	Doesn't accept my overseas number so can't register.	1
9678	Severe issue with concurrently having Bluetooth devices connected. How was this not even tested?	2
9679	I got stuck on the very second question of questionnaire about risk group. No reaction to "continue" button after picking the answer, on WiFi or mobile data. I've deleted the app and will stick to usual precautions without it.	1

9694	I have a bad experience with this apps, this apps not working in many old phones even iPhone 6 also doesn't support this apps, because apple has stopped updating iOS for iPhone 6 and previous models. This apps only supports latest iOS 13 or above. The developer supposed to think about it that the apps should have work on all types phone. Because of the lockdown many people now jobless & no earning sources, now in this circumstances how is it possible to buy a new phone for labours???	2

9706	This app has an inherent flaw - it only alerts you if you have been in contact with someone once they report it in the app, which could be days later after you were in contact with them. \n\nSo if someone was infected and didn’t know for a week, and you were in contact with them during that time, you could have been possibly infected too, and you only learn it once the person who infected you tests positive and reports it, sometimes 10 days after you were in contact with them, when they could have been infectious.  During that time you could have infected more people yourself.\n\nThe app is not foolproof and is dependent on people getting tested and reporting a positive case as soon as they develop symptoms or suspect they could be carrying the virus.	2

9714	App crash whenever SafeEntry check-in is tapped on is fixed for me. The new design is nice. However, would appreciate if the app were to adopt the Apple-Google Exposure Notification API (this setting is now shown as being “not available in your region” in settings).	2

9761	This app causes me so many problems with my Bluetooth speaker, Bluetooth phone to car connection, and Bluetooth wireless headphone to phone connection. Bluetooth signal drops out, very frustrating as one of the main uses for my phone is to listen to media, audio books, podcasts etc using this technology. It's very frustrating and I'm considering deleting the app because of these issues. People will not want to download this app with annoying problems like these that aren't fixed.	1

9833	Maybe the devs should learn geofencing and mesh network. It does using gps and bluetooth. Do not depends on general data by official only. Give an allert when close to "recorded RT" only please. It is not usefull enough and drainning battery UPDATE: another update and should make new login session. So ... I'll just wait and see ... my friends respond	1

9837	Force Closed!!!	2
9838	When i installed the app only once it is working.. Then again when i reopen to check the status i can't open the app its automatically closing.	2
9839	Pointless as it only works if I have GPS on all day which flattens the battery. So I've had it installed for months, but hardly ever works as I disable GPS most of the time. Wouldn't it be better to still capture near Bluetooth device details regardless of location by GPS?	2
9840	Bad app. There is always an issue with date of birth. One cannot enter the date of birth while registering for the first time.	1

Uninstalled it and all is fine again. Edit: Developers response seems to be standard reply for everyone reporting this problem. What other details do they need?! There is apparently widespread BT interference in this app that uses BT scanning. Happening on all our latest Samsung phones, Android 10.	2

9907	Installing the app requires Android OS 6 onward- so already facing the gap of many in the community having no mobiles- added to this you have to have a recent upgrade which is unrealistic on Android (the most widespread mobile OS)	2
9908	Very poor apps. Dose not working properly. Whole day requesting for registration only. And even u call to hotline 109 to solve the problem. Nothing happen. So this apps is totally worse. \ud83d\udc4e	1

9914	I like that the app turns on automatically once I turn on Bluetooth, but I still find myself double-checking ?? would appreciate a small icon in the top icon row that shows it's on (where you have battery life, time, headphones, Bluetooth icon etc). Also, as some have suggested, it would be good to know how many devices mine has interacted with.	0
9915	Keep showing me invalid IC just because my IC start with T and not S. Kindly do fix that.	2

9917	Uninstalled! When I installed the App I started to get audio glitches and freezes when using my Bluetooth headphones. Updated all music Apps, cleared App caches, reset and updated headphones but still getting glitches a couple of times each song. Very annoying. Uninstalled the App and now everything is working perfectly! The Contact Tracing element of the App is obviously interfering with the Bluetooth signal to the headphones when it searches for nearby devices. When a fix for this is announced I will try the App again, until then my music takes priority. Phone:- Huawei P30 Lite, Headphones:- Sony WH-CH700N	1

9942	It's a good initiative, and will surely help in tracking, as long as everyone will install it. But, ever since I installed it, my battery has been draining quite fast. I used to charge once a day, but now I have to charge 3 times a day. I guess it is the price to pay to help out with tracking the virus... EDIT: After a restart, battery usage seemed to be back to normal. Maybe battery issues were not due to the app at all... sorry about that...	0

9944	Zain just lost a loyal customer for the last decade. After learning that the company was involved in creating such a horrendous app, I was quite irritated by the fact that I weren't able to rest or take shower mid-day fearing that I'd miss the notification. What frustrated me even more was "bugfixes" update that's total BS. I myself am a developer & wouldn't put such false claims, even if the app was crappy (such as yours). Alas, I'll be disposing my Touch lebanese SIM (part of Zain) as well.	1
9945	No issues so far, pretty straight forward. Happy to take this step to nail the COVID-19, and to protect my family and fellow Australians.	0
9946	App is very good but much better if it shows how many affected per day also. Just a suggestion	0

9952	Can the developers of this app please confirm when the battery drain issue will be fixed? I will have no option but to uninstall (reluctantly) if this problem persists. Contact with developers. Told to uninstall and download again. Battery drain is still as bad.	1
9953	I had to uninstall the app as my battery was draining monstrously fast (had to completely recharge my phone 3 times in 24 hours). Will install back once I know this problem has been sorted as it is unfeasable to not have a reliable battery when out and about.	1

In this I much prefer to use the singpass mobile version and I really don't want to switch unless this app can offer these functions at least.

9978	Intermittent disruptions to my phone's (Xperia 5) bluetooth connection with my car audio. This is clearly a widespread issue (anecdotal and reviews) that is not limited to any smartphone and audio brand. I'm giving it 2 stars because it does scan QR code amazingly fast so good job there.	2
9979	Downloaded the Covid Tracker app as soon as it was launched & it seemed to be working fine with no issues until this weekend when my battery drained down from fully charged to 3% in a couple of hours although I hadn't been using my phone. I heard there was a problem with the app so deleted it but just reinstalled it having heard that the app had been updated yesterday & the battery issue was now resolved. Strangely enough when I reinstalled the app the date of the last update is July...	1
9980	Drains my phone battery terribly badly. After installing app and giving it all it's requested permissions my phone feel warm the entire day and when I checked, it's battery drain was whopping 40% ! Omg, this app is gonna damage my battery really soon !	1
9981	After doing the latest updation, the barcode is not loading. Only one Question Mark (?) is showing in the barcode place. Now I can't enter anywhere.. What to do?? Please resolve this issue asap pls.	2
9982	Very good app please make more easy to use	0
9983	Govt backed app with unknown developer. Who developed it ?	1
9984	I hope more people participate in this app. This technology is what helped South Korea achieve one of the world’s fastest recovery rates, despite their initial spike in cases. \n\nPeople keep saying “at least we doing are better than USA” but they have set their bar so low! Is it really a surprise if a person who brought an umbrella to safely commute through a storm is dryer than someone who believes they can avoid being wet just by willing it? Our country should be striving to adopt processes and meet the achievements of successful global leadership, not be complacent with one-upping countries who yet to put in any effort at all...\n\nRe: tracking, this app doesn’t track location with GPS, it monitors proximity to others with your Bluetooth radio.	0

10001	First, I like to thank our gov efforts for setting up this app for the contact tracing for COVID-19. However, I feel that more improvement can be done especially for people who are using the app & the token as many of us has collected the token but still need to download the app becuase not all the places are able to scan the token. Second, it would be better if we use the app without using the bluetooth as bluetooth drains up our hp battery quickly. Thanks.	0

10017	It doesn't recognise the presense of an internet connection be it Wifi or Mobile Data.	2
10018	Seems fine and not much battery drain. However, can't say if it works and if it's efficient since too few people have installed the app. Welcome to the new era where Emocracy rhymes with Trumpidity of the mass.	0

10020	Hi Developer, At the moment, i'm am fine with the app. However, as a non savvy tech user, I'm wondering if bluetooth does consume my battery? Can i suggest if app can add in a "at home's" features? So i could switch off bluetooth when i am at home.	0

10057	Doesn't send activation code when foreign country code is used.	2
10058	I actually did bother trying to read the privacy assessment, and it appears quite genuine. They allow a pseudonym, but you have the use a mobile phone number to activate it (rather than an anonymous email address), and so that's a bit pointless. But it should make contact tracing easier (which happens solely manually normally) so I support this effort.	1

Edit: Thx 4 reply. Oppo user > Battery >Energy Saver> Trace> Disable Background Freeze, Abnormal Apps Optimisation, Doze.

10130	Originally gave this a high review. Since then I have had a lot of issues with my phone maintaining connection with other Bluetooth devices. The worst instance was when it unpaired with my car which rendered my navigation and voice control unusable until I rebooted and re-paired it. Also suffering significant battery drain on a phone that can usually go 2 days without a recharge (galaxy a70). Also noticing shorter battery on my smart watch as it has to keep reconnecting to the phone as well.	1
10131	Seems that after installing this app it somehow is memory exhaustive app keep hanging when I tried to check in hv to reboot my hp and i juz switching to this app from singpass 2 days ago it hangs on me 2 days in a row	2
10132	A chart with total confirmed ICUs over time would be very helpful, as confirmed cases depend too much on the size of the tested sample, ICU seems to be a better measure to understand the context.

10150	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

10205	Reading the permissions and the reasons provided this app goes against the international GDPR laws, that said also you do not need access to a users media to check for a root or jailbreak to validate the security patch on ones phone, that also being said in a country where Hauwei is a major partner to the telecoms and a very popular phone brand that has been stripped of googles security patches and is using EMUI a rooted enabled version.

I have deleted and reinstall , I clear the phone cache too. But still fail. I'm using android phone. Can anyone help me? I have repeat same sequence. Uninstall and reinstall again today. Still not function. It says app not working. Why is that so? By allowing the bluetooth to turn on is still not good enough? How than?	2

Given that if I'd like to sign up for it on a weekend there wouldn't be anyone to answer my query would there? I also can't sign up using my singpass. Unnecessary information collected as well.

I hope the developer will never make another app in his or her lifetime.	1

10315	Make this app for rooted device also, those who have rooted will get superuser permission, and tell them to grant superuser access.	2
10316	Read in paper today that 500k people have uninstalled this app due to battery killing issue. How on earth is this issue not resolved at this stage??? This is going on 3 weeks now! Was in Donegal recently for 3 day break,staying in a busy hotel, it would have been extremely useful to have had this app but as it runs my battery down in 3 hrs not an option. Seriously, please get off your hands and fix this please!!!	1
10317	I can't log in or open at this moment..why?	2
10318	App is overloading phone system and draining battery	1
10319	You have no guarantees using this app and the safeentry system that your data is secure and only used for contact tracing, unlike systems in e.g. the UK. This is normalising government surveillance for the population	1

10341	Ok	0
10342	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0

10352	Great app, every Australian should get it! I'd give 5 stars but for 1 reason. I really don't like the permanent lock screen notification that the app is 'protecting' me. I don't care. I just want it to work quietly in the background and not bother me until it needs to. I'd be quite surprised if any user wants the app to remind them it is there every time they pick up their phone. Please create a setting to turn this off -- then you'll get my 5 stars.	0

10360	Consumes a lot of battery usage	1
10361	Frustrating to set up. The app will not accept your phone number, saying there is an error with your phone number, if there is a problem on the previous screen. Where you enter your name, the supplied model shows "First, Family" name implying to put a comma between your names, but doing so gives the message on the subsequent page about the phone number. In addition where you enter your number, the prefix +61 is written for you. But you must enter the initial zero, despite international protocols	1
10362	Anything that can help keep people safe	2
10363	Read in paper today that 500k people have uninstalled this app due to battery killing issue. How on earth is this issue not resolved at this stage??? This is going on 3 weeks now!

10373	The data should be updated daily, usually some data is updated after few days. I think French government should enforce every smart app user to download.	2
10374	Good thank you	0
10375	Can't to get verification code number repeat??	2
10376	Got a new phone. Huawei p40pro. The OTP part just goes on non-stop. No response from there. Developer response to contact them if there r further issues. I can't even get further than OTP. Will fix it in future versions. I say come out with the next version ASAP. When virus spread, it doesn't wait for next version. Imagine a break in contact tracing just because of an App failure.	2
10377	Good	0
10378	Nice app	0
10379	This app is useless it seems to constantly switch off, I have to keep rebooting it. Perhaps it's my Bluetooth but if people download it and think it's working properly then it is giving the community a false sense of security and inaccurate information.	1
10380	Free anti virus software, I guess. BUT you may need to visit the play store to update it directly, as it seems resistant to auto updates.	2
10381	When I try to open the app it comes as app has stopped and nothing work cannot even register	2
10382	Cannot get OTP if you change phone.	2
10383	Good	0
10384	No source code available, do not trust it. Open source software ensures the validity and security of the app by allowing independent review, inspection and oversight, and is further more recommended by the eHealth community and WHO. If the app is vulnerable, showing the source code does not change that vulnerability, nor does it stop anyone for exploiting it, rather it stops all the open source developers from finding and solving the issue.	2
10385	Working fine. An excellent tool to track the contacts of COVID19 positive and will definitely help the healthcare officials fight this virus with help of individuals in society. My concern is that Bluetooth remains permanently ON, user should be able to switch off when he is in home.	0

10391	Unable to send OTP for mobile number verification. Resent multiple times but still don't receive any SMS OTP	2
10392	Great app considering it may actually save your life! The fact that app stores so little data compared to lots of other apps, data is stored locally on your phone, government needs your consent to upload your data to server and privacy is protected legislation means the risk of data loss/loss of privacy is minimal. In fact lots of other apps upload lot more data about u to servers on the internet without you knowing! Source code has been released &does what ithey claims. See COVIDSafe help	0
10393	Useless application.	1
10394	Good	0
10395	Uninstalled it. Was draining battery and kept telling me to restart my phone. Annoying.	1
10396	Battery killer. The app is really good (I wish I could see cases from the graph tho) but since I've installed it my battery is draining so fast. And my Samsund Galaxy S8 is getting warm. I now charge fully my mobile 3 times a day! I have to uninstall it. It's disappointing as the app I well needed and it is at least we can do to get a handle on Covid! I would reinstall if the issue is fixed.	1
10397	App is not working on the new Huawei P40 Pro.	2
10398	Quick Checkin QR scanner doesn't work.	2
10399	I can't sign in. Error registering . After many tries I received otp and again it says error.	2
10400	It drains my battery like nothing else. It is great to be covid safe but if my phone dies at 2pm it doesn't help anymore. In average it takes about 20-25% of my battery which is unbearable.	1
10401	It's very good!	0
10402	Cannot start on android 11. For others, Android 11 enables to use it without actually having location on. (Google thing)	2
10403	I didn't get the option to register and when trying to log in with EID and mobile number, I get an error message says "user not found". How to fix this issue?	2
10404	When so much is at stake, in terms of lives, livelihoods, all aspects of wellbeing and quality of life, I feel that downloading this app is the least that I can do. I am confident the limited data collected will not be misused and I found the app itself to be really quick and straightforward to download and set up. One of the other reviewers said to omit the \u20180\u2019 when entering mobile numbers to fit with the international dialling format. Maybe this is why I did not experience the same issues as a few others. In any case, it is great to see so many people being proactive about downloading this app. Please let\u2019s all work together and do whatever it takes to beat the coronavirus, look after our communities and help restore health to all aspects of our beautiful nation.	0
10405	This is a great idea. To anyone who's paranoid about privacy, you likely give away much more info on a regular basis through games, social media, shopping & other online activity - suck it up, princess. To anyone who's had the "INVALID PHONE NUMBER" error, I did too on day after release, but it seems to be fixed now. Download it, wash your hands, stay home and stay safe \ud83d\ude0a	0

10407	Badly optomized, cannot display their text properly	2
10408	Cannot open n scan qr code	0
10409	The battery drain the app causes in recent weeks is actually crippling my ability to take my phone outside. Until they fix this, I don't think I can have this app run in the background. For context, 7 hours run in the background has used 30% of my battery.	2
10410	Very Good	0
10411	I feel the app is getting slower and slower each day updating the daily numbers. Also I can't understand why local numbers are always two days out of date when rte has already put out local numbers by 6.20 each day. The app was supposed to be all up to date to fight covid.	1
10412	Application is not working properly. after splash screen when the app navigate towards main dashboard it automatically get close.	2

10466	I keep getting message that it will be installed on my device soon I do not understand. Is it my device is the problem	2
10467	Hey, iPhone users outside Singapore cannot use it. Please, also allow to choose Country in iProducts.	2
10468	Good	0
10469	Waste of time just a government scam to keep tracks on you	2
10470	Fabulous way to track Covid- especially if the spread continues.\n\nUser friendly. \n\n1 star reviewers might need to revisit their Facebook/Snapchat/tok tok accounts if they are worried about privacy and password encryption.	0
10471	Seems to be working with no dramas. Doesn't appear to be affecting my battery life much (Samsung Galaxy s9).	2
10472	I'm now getting notification of risky encounter almost everyday day, but in some days I don't remember any situation which met the criteria less than 2m more than 15min it would help a lot to get time of the encounter to be able to consider if situation was really risky or it's false. It would be also great to get actual info about restrictions in the region i'm currently in.	1

10477	App keeps turning itself off. Have to constantly open app and allow tracking. Defeats the purpose! I should be able to turn it on and leave it on. So I can be tracked!	1
10478	Broken, won't work. Uninstalled. Won't run in the background at all with all settings allowed. Only runs when the app is on the screen.	2
10479	app causes my Bluetooth to keep disconnecting when in areas with high human traffic	2
10480	When I put my EID and number, it says my number is wrong even though I never changed my number. Unfortunately, I can't give this app a 0/5. I still can't login. Customer service is also worse since they don't answer.	1
10481	Excellent	0
10482	cannot write "/" to date on password reset	2
10483	I've had the app on my Oppo for quite a while now. No matter how many times I set the permissions to disable battery optimisation, it never, ever sticks. Every time I look at my phone, it says I've chosen for that app in particular to use up as much juice as it likes. But the app says it's not active and I need to check my permissions again. The last advice I found online, was to uninstall the app, update my OS and reinstall. But when I did that I found I already have the latest update!	1
10484	Looking for the app has been fixed	0
10485	Fantastic, registration was easier and faster	0
10486	Intermittent disruptions to my phone's (Xperia 5) bluetooth connection with my car audio. This is clearly a widespread issue (anecdotal and reviews) that is not limited to any smartphone and audio brand. I'm giving it 2 stars because it does scan QR code amazingly fast so good job there.	2

10502	Had to delete it yesterday because my battery was drained in about 2 hours. Phone won't charge fast enough to keep up with the battery drainage. Looked like an easy to use app so hopefully it can be fixed to resolve the battery drainage issue.	1
10503	Still killing my battery several weeks after supposedly being fixed. Not good enough for an app that is so important......!!!	1
10504	Unable to login	1
10505	Good	0
10506	No Google cannot use? Seriously? Don't tell me cause of it, you can't sent otp to us. WhatsApp also can be install on hms device and request otp successfully. Please go back to drawing board if you are lazy to develop this app	2
10507	It is not the best app	1
10508	Make this compatible with Huawei phones without Google (e.g. Huawei P40 Pro). Currently unable to receive OTP.	2
10509	Easy easy. Easy to install, eazy to register. Other than that, it works by itself. Only need to keep phone on and bluetooth on. No uploads till you are requested to upload by health authority.	0

10516	I will not phone support. If an app like this requires to call support, it is beyond useless. \nHow about just fixing the obvious bugs?	1

10537	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0
10538	used for fake-diagnosing protestors. this is ridiculous as a response to your response, the app is not decentralized, as you're literally writing this as the ministry of digitalization, as well as the fact that your logo and app appears on public government conferences and is supported by the government. the app isn't supposed to physically quarantine someone, it's supposed to spread fear. ***** *** #StrajkKobiet	1

10553	Why can't download this App	2
10554	Terrible app. Always have connection problem	2
10555	Had problems signing up today. The keyboard disappeaered and I wasn't able to enter my profile information. I was eventually able to enter it in the app via the profile page, but let's just say the onboarding wasn't smooth. I would really like the option of authenticating against my RealMe account and its 2FA and my core information, rather than creating yet another account and yet another 2FA service.	2

10569	Great initiative and effort, well done. Sadly my battery life is definitely affected by this app. My Bluetooth connectivity to my watch and headphones is also significantly more problematic. However, during these times we all have to sacrifice, but work towards fixing these (if possible) and make it better experience.	1

10581	Just tried to sign up now and the app is live, telling me, my number is invalid and I've had this number for years	2
10582	The idea of the app is good, but since i install it, it conflicts with other apps, for instance the QNB mobile app it can't be loaded while Ehteraz is on i have to uninstall ehteraz, and install it back once I'm done with QNB app	0
10583	Had to uninstall. Constantly stopping and requires manual restart. Too frustrating.	1

10625	Nice app	0
10626	Initially i thought it to be a good initiative, but it was a myth. At the Helpline number all they do is encourage you to write an email to support email id. Wrong result displayed on the app for the last 2 days despite requesting them and emailing them. A typical sarkari app where people are reluctant to work.	1

10656	Causes all other app updates to fail. Have tested numerous times with multiple reboots and then uninstalling. When I have this app installed, all of my Play Store app updates stall and fail. As soon as I uninstall this app, everything works perfectly again. Hope this can be fixed. Tried again with 1.0.17 and 1.0.18 and 1.0.21 - no different.

10684	Waste of time	1
10685	There is only check in option and no check out option. For MRT will be confusing of when to check out on our first location. And when we reach our destination, no check out option. So we have to check out on our first location and do a check in on our final location and immediately check out on our final location. Not user friendly.	2

10710	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful...

10716	The worst app at all. Your full battery will be finished within 1 hour. people who are using manual mobile, Blackberry mobile or low internal spaced mobile then they couldn't register. Can run this app in different mobiles with the same ID at once so the covid 19 affected person also can carry and go anywhere with the green coded apps by others name. Many people have finished their visa and waiting for the flight to be opened so they also cannot register.	1

It's an intrusion into our privacy. Whatever spin you are telling us, we just don't buy it. Data security? Well you don't exactly have a good track record on that. Before the election, you said it wasn't mandatory but now that the election is over, you say its mandatory. And you still expect us to believe u	2

10743	Easy to use. Useful, reliable and convenient.	0
10744	The OTP came in more than 1 minute. Before I could type in the OTP, the verification page went off. After re-installation of the app, seems that I am registered, despite no OTP was entered.	2
10745	Nice app. Specially when entering to supermarkets its asking to show the status. I heard this app will give alarm if im close to infected. Is that true ?	0
10746	Application is great excellent idea but Battery goes down very fast my full charged phone lasts couple of hours ! Why would you want access to my private information!! My storage which include my private family pic and otheres ! No privacy by using this app while iphone holders have no issues with this !	1
10747	Good	0
10748	I can't register, do not get SMS verification code for few days. It says "Unable to fulfill your process temporarily. Try again larer". Is there anyone from support team to give some explanation?	2
10749	Ye aap kis liye hai modi g	0
10750	I kept getting invalid phone number. I turned off WIFI on my phone and then it worked/registered straight away. Should have better error messages. Should have Unable to verify phone number and turn WIFI off to register.	2
10751	Easy to setup, simple and hopefully effective, play your part and download today #covid19 #inthistogether	0
10752	Good app	0
10753	This is an infringment on the freedoms of the humans. GOD will not let this continue.	1
10754	I can't use the app. It keeps saying network issue not connected to Internet...	2
10755	This application is not working Properly. It doesn't deserve even 1 \ud83c\udf1f. Please repair this App. I am trying to Sign up but error message comes as "Something went Wrong Try again"	1

10765	I have been trying to register, all informations that i input are correct my bluetooth is open, location service is open, but keeps receiving "error requesting OTP" then when i received the OTP error said "error registering" i tried so many time, i already uninstall and install the app over and over again. I also tried calling the number given for tech issues but it's always busy and keeps saying someone will call within two hours but no one calls. Frustrating. Stressful	2
10766	Whatever has happened this app is destroying the battery on my phone. I have had to charge it three times alone today.	1
10767	Doesn’t work in rule areas when you’re not around other people	1
10768	This app is useless. Not updating the contacts with whom i have been in contact from last 10 days.	1
10769	Not sending OTP...waited too long	2
10770	The battery issues have meant I have had no choice but to delete the app.	1
10771	Cant even sign up..OTP never arrive.	2
10772	Perfect	0
10773	Good	0
10774	I can't log in to begin with. App should be very user friendly to enable the whole population to install it and remain safe	2
10775	Good	0
10776	Unnecessary publicity by government never gona help anyone from covid. maybe it steal the data	1
10777	Have to check manually that it's always turned on, even though Bluetooth is on at all times. The notification may disappear. Will ensure that the Trace Together icon will always appear on top of screen	2
10778	Works fine!  Let\u2019s get this done together so we can all go back to our normal lives!	0
10779	I know if nothing is reliable than you have to keep your belief on something this app is little bit just like the same. I have noticed many times the data providing with this app is quite different from other counters which losts it's authenticity although this is a government app.	2
10780	This app is very useful ??	0
10781	Absolute trash of an app.	1
10782	Works well. Tracetogether, fight Covid-19 together!	0
10783	Today morning 09.06.2020 I open the ETHERAZ app and I was notified to update it which I did but it keeps on not responding to my Huawei Y9s. Had to reboot my phone to start afresh but nothing seems to work out so am just stranded I hope you fix the bug	2
10784	Not good hundreds time register ing but fail	1
10785	Good	0
10786	about this app must be in Bengali. ?? ??????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ????? ???	0
10787	I have many Bluetooth/ traced contracts even I stay at home with my wife. It reached sometimes 90+ per hour. I removed the app and reinstalled but it seems normal. Is that an expected behaviour or can I just ignore that? It seems odd since there is nobody around me most of the time.	1
10788	The app drains my battery even with BT off and optimized battery function on.	1
10789	Great detail in the app, just a pity is is 2 or, sometimes, even 3 days behind.	0
10790	It doesn't allow me to pause this app for more than 8 hours. When I am working from home full day, I have to go in and pause this app every 8 hours. When I sleep more than 8hrs, it starts searching for bluetooth and draining my battery. However that comes up with this fixed hours pause has air up in the head.	1
10791	Good app	0
10792	Very good app it is like bodyguard I used arogya setu app when my mother was ill and it helped me with direct consultancy of doctors but after someday that feature had gone we all need that feature again	0

10794	Imagine forcing us to keep bluetooth on.. AND FORCED PUSH NOTIFICATION WOW	2
10795	Very nice app	0
10796	Well done....try to push it	0
10797	Good app	0
10798	I installed the app, it was easy to install and seems working OK but since the app doesn\u2019t give live feedback to the user due to the privacy of other users, there is no practical way to know if it is working as it should be.   My main concern and suggestion is that it only works on the phone and not on the watch. Phones are not easy to sanitise each time you go out and come back that is why, whenever I go grocery shopping i only have my Apple Watch with me since I can have my calls, texts and payments with it and I can wash it while washing my hands when I come home. Therefore my phone shows no contact with anyone.	0
10799	Terrible terrible terrible app. I've spent two days trying to register and still cannot. sms OTP never reaches my foreign number, no option for email OTP, no way to ask for assistance and trouble shoot. Got local number just for this useless app, then it still fails every time, because it now says my data connection isn't working, when every other app works fine. Tried both WiFi and data, switched phone on and off, uninstalled and reinstalled. Same issue. Can't go anywhere in Singapore now. \ud83d\udca9	2

10804	Every week i have the issue to check out, keep promt me network issue. I use data or wifi also facing same issue. Restart the phone also same issue. How many times i need to uninstall and reinstall this app?! Its happen weekly.	2
10805	This is a Bayanihan effort by the developers! Let's help our fellow citizens and our country by staying safe.	0
10806	Not instaling	2
10807	The idea is great, but still drains the battery even after reinstalling it after recent update.	1
10808	Does what it should, and with a great minimalistic UI. Love that the 'little dev company' has proven the Big Four wrong!	0
10809	Heavy battery draining	1

10814	A lot has changed in four hours it seems. Registration worked fine and it is set up. Straightforward and hoping I never get an alert!	0
10815	After the July update, it asked for location permission. What's going on?	2
10816	Cant open the app, even after updating it is the same....	1
10817	I don't think the radius alert is even remotely reliable. It potentially can give false sense of security .	2
10818	Very secure and private system	0
10819	Very poorly implemented App. Have a look at apps like Tile which implement background Bluetooth well. Cannot use audio devices while this App is enabled.	1
10820	Hi may I know if this app is the genuine one as earlier one was blue and no NRIC details required	1
10821	Protected app	0
10822	Forced to install this app by my company. There's an annoying notification that stays on my notification bar forever. Drains battery like crazy, and after I installed it, keeps causing my bt to disconnect. Horrible app. Once again, I was FORCED to install this, maybe so some higher up can hit their kpi with the inflated number of downloads.	1
10823	Good	0
10824	good	0
10825	Put the app on the phone like they said have not had a problem with it Blue tooth OK.	0
10826	Very well	0
10827	The App would occasionally cause interference to my car entertainment system when listening to music from my phone via Bluetooth. This would happen when my car is next to another. The problem goes away after the App is uninstalled. Would briefing great if Developer could look into this matter.	2
10828	I'd been using this OK for months and (probably after an update) I discovered it was asking for location access and no battery optimisation. Having allowed those, it started draining the battery - 27% one day. I removed it, rebooted the phone and reinstalled the app. So far so good today. About 5th in the list of battery users at 1.8%.	1
10829	Downloading the app was really easy! I'm experiencing just one issue on the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom running ColorOS 6: although I've already given the app permission to run on background and ignore battery optimisation settings, it still shows a "x". Maybe this issue can be fixed by not trying to detect battery optimisation permissions on ColorOS because I think it's not classified as such.	1

10834	Can’t get past this. Enabled every setting in my software settings, enabled every notification banner, still says it’s not enabled. Not sure what to do from here and so I just removed the app.	2
10835	Why have you guys stopped showing the active cases?? One can surely benefit by being cautious of the known localities where active cases are.	2
10836	I indicated my IC NO. and it said that i had filled in wrongly when it was correct.	2

10855	need more shortcuts/widgets for check in and check out like iOS	2
10856	Very simple,straightforward and user friendly. No issues with it at all and it ensures that we all do our basic bit to contain this virus.

10857	Great help	0
10858	Good and neat tracking app however battery gone flat within 6 hours,	1
10859	I've installed the app because my love for our community far outweighs my paranoia - just do it!	0
10860	Cant recover password. It keeps saying something went wrong. Please try again later. Try again later same thing. So what's up with that ?	2
10861	Good apps for protect to corona	0
10862	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0

10885	Got logged out overnight I assume from app update or some other backend update. You’re going to lose usage of the app this way.	1
10886	I don't know how this app is saving us where you can only see the numbers of positive or negative. But there isn't any another option that any covid positive is near you withing 5 to 10 mtr and it is not notifying us that "stay alert a person near you is covid positive."	1
10887	Draining my battery. Lots of chat about this online but no notifications from HSE. Staying quiet and hoping it goes away or that ordinary people will figure it out for themselves is not a strategy that inspires trust. Is this what happened with the Nursing Homes?	1

If your in the same room as someone for 15 mins, you will be marked as a contact for that person. If that person catches covid, your app will inform you of it, allowing you to self isolate and prevent the spread of the disease Do your part by installing this app and keeping your Bluetooth on	0
10988	Doesn't work, no safe entry button on main screen, my phone is Xiaomi redmi note 9s, android 10. After brief email exchange with support, turns out app doesn't work with passport no. Sing is my 2nd home, claim to be global hub, so very weird way to deter foreigner with no IC, making it more difficult to do the right thing. When tracetogether becomes the only mandatory way, I'm told I should show my passport instead. Back to stone age. Speechless!	2

10995	Battery drain issue is unworkable. Alert us when fixed!	1
10996	I can't even register, I tried so many times but I can't register, it's showing sometimes error or id expired.	2
10997	very very useful	0
10998	Lousy	2
10999	I tried installing it several times thinking that they were unsuccessful, until I finally gave up. On the last install, thinking it was still unsuccessful, I left it on the phone and went to sleep... suddenly the next morning, I found that it was successfully installed. Perhaps something could be done about the problem, so that more people would install this Apps on their phone.	2
11000	There was bug when calling or receive call, screen goes off even hang up phone.	2
11001	Easy to install. Simply explains the data sharing and storage.	0
11002	Super easy to set up and could well save lives. It is indeed excellent to live in Australia.	0
11003	Check your battery level after a hour of bluetooth always on...Completely useless!	1
11004	This is the worst app I've ever seen. After app update, it goes to inactive mode. What a shame?? Finally decided to uninstall this today. I need to save some battery, which is this app only capable of.	1
11005	I am travelling tomorrow and it gives me error while I am logging in.. please help urgently.. Saying "there is some error logging you in"	2
11006	?t worked fine until the other day. Now my permanent HES code isn't coming up but when I search it the app doesn't recognize me as the user. Someone must have spilled tea on their keyboard when updating the program. #turkiye	2

11011	18 Sept: the app start to prompt the safe entry QR code is unavailable. please assist to check and advise. thank you.	2
11012	Force closed everytime I try to start the application.	2
11013	Although i got an error message saying the otp was wrong, when i clicked 'resend otp' it lets me proceed with the rest of the setup and the app is now working for me. In case u get the same issue, try this trick. App may have setup issues for some of us, but not everyone gets these issues, so try the app for urself. Let's aim to get as many pple on the app as possible so it can keep us all safe & stop covid-19 without shutting down our city.	2
11014	Thank for my health	0
11015	App keeps saying theres no internet connection when I have full bars, cant access it	2

11026	Glad to finally see this app up and running. Very quick and easy to install. Suggestion: Can you integrate TikTok into this? or a game mode?.. Something, just something to get people to install it. The tin foil sales have went through the roof with this app as "It's a government spy tool" is all I am hearing.. Integrate TikTok and I guarantee this will be one of the most downloaded apps on Play Store. Jokes aside! Good job, we are all in this together!	0

11032	SafeEntry from long press TraceTogether icon should remember any previous check in and prompt out check out screen, instead of showing scan QR code for new check in. This occurred when closing app (kill task) after check in.	2
11033	Dont know how it will actually work, but few first impressions: Setting your phone to constantly use GPS + BT is not good. The battery consumption level is crazy. Language setting: Guys, set your phone language to Swe/Fin in order to control the app language selection. Also: localization to Eng should not be a hard task to do, why wait?	1
11034	I input the correct particulars, but they were flagged as being in error. Please help.	2
11035	be important if we get another cluster or 2nd wave.. this could be useful..	1
11036	Should have a function to detect version level between mobile device's and GooglePlay's. So we don't waste time re-updating our app when we encounter a corrupted QR code which directs us to do so.	2

11049	my comments are still like everyone, there is no any feedback feature for users who has been installing and inputing their data into this app. i suggest the developer can give some maps which has detailed information about location of someone who got corona, so users can do physical distancing more effective and efficiently.	1
11050	Very effective	0
11051	OK	0
11052	The app is saying that I have an expired ID, but my ID is still valid. Also, my colleagues using iPhones cannot use the app because it is asking them to upgrade the OS version, but cannot because of the phone model.	2

11082	It's a great idea, and I have used it since release. I just realised though that I have lately started to forget to checking. Perhaps there should be a push notification to prompt users to check in?	0

11117	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

11183	Uninstalled. If you want people to use this, the least you can do is to respect their privacy and their agency. Allow it to be disabled when necessary. Allow it to work without location permissions. You expect people to co-operate when you treat them with such hubris? This is all too typical of the heavy-handed and inconsistent response of this government.	1

11243	Great that we have this app to assist tracing. Would be nice to see the stats and info that the RoI app displays. For the privacy concerns, there are no permissions other than Bluetooth and network access. If you are comfortable using Facebook, TikTok, Twitter etc on your phone, then this app doesn't even compare for privacy implications. You already carry a box of sensors in your pocket already, sending your data in all directions.	0

11278	Not able to go further than the logo screen. Any tips on what could be wrong or how to make it work? Already tried giving it all permissions	1
11279	One of the most wonderful App	0
11280	After calling 109, you don't solve the issue but taking details and inform someone from technical team will call within 24 to 48 hours surely. I prefer if you can reset the app on the spot ones you get down the caller details. Am already stuck inhouse more than 48 hours, I don't have enough food then I have to wait for more than 24hrs and am not sure if the issue will be solved. Am still waiting.	1
11281	drain battery too fast that make me uninstall the apps...cos is no use for me...	1
11282	Easy to use!	0
11283	After installation I found my battery was draining quite quickly. I uninstalled the app and my battery stopped draining so quickly. So there has to be something the way this app operates that is causing it too use up a lot of battery life.	1

Wrong Credentials your number is not registered logout and log in with your number 971****.....you can know this unknown number by installing du app... Or Etisalat App.... Then go to alternative number.... You will find the unknown number there.... Good luck all	0
11292	I hope its a good app. But its loads my battery charge more. Please fix it.	1
11293	Good idea but impossible to enter data directly into app - have to cut and paste from another app as keyboard will not come up on phone. For an app designed to be used on a phone very frustrating.	1

11310	A great app until it drained my battery on Saturday. I had to uninstall it.	1
11311	Very bad app its make my mobile slow and the battrey ends quickly	1
11312	Reinstall a few days later worked, but why is it needing location approval. It's a contact information not a location information app.	2
11313	To promote confidence in this app, it should be able to report its activity, in terms of how many connections it has registered recently and over time, and (with permission) how many it is currently registering, in real time. That would also promote some interest and curiosity among users.	1
11314	V good	0
11315	Why this apps sometimes working some no	2
11316	Errors. Couldn't get anything out of it. No text message as promised either ! I'll uninstall it. Don't have time for playful developers	1
11317	Some people say that the app is using BLUETOOTH and GPS, of course that is how the CoViD-19 Exposure API works. Apple and Google clearly said that it will use Bluetooth to ping bluetooth signals from your phone to other phones within the Bluetooth Range (kahit i-search mo pa sa Google). So if using this app, PLEASE 'wag nyo i-off ang Bluetooth. It will render the app useless. App is great but I think the developer of the app should team up with DOH to provide some case info kasi based dito sa app wala paraw CoViD cases dito sa amin even though na mayroon na. 3 Stars lang rating ko kasi some data (like ilang taong positive sa isang lugar) are incomplete. Always remember guys to wash our hands, wear face masks and observe social distancing. Together we heal as one!	0

One note though.. the app is heave on battery consumption and Bluetooth activity.. this is evident in reduced battery life and heating in many Android and iPhone devices.

11334	Uninstalled - waiting for the update to the DP-3T decentralized protocol used by Germany (and approved by Google and Apple) that protects privacy and doesn't need all encounters stored centrally - only uploads encounters to government servers when a person tests positive and contact tracing is actually needed.	1

11402	Need to address battery drain issue .. and show its usage in the battery usage chart Need to allow automatic (probably GPS based) turning off when at home Need to have clearer icon on notification panel to indicate whether if the app is running.

11412	Completely ruined my battery. Since downloading my battery drops a percentage by the minute, even faster if my phone is in use. Even when not in use and data/Bluetooth is turned off, my battery drains itself. Have uninstalled but am still now facing battery issues.	1
11413	1 star for not using the baked in API provided by google and apple. Would not trust this government with my fecal matter let alone any data. I tried and deleted the app. Developer is lazy and government is untrustworthy.	1

11417	Initially was working fine. Recently notice that it is not working when I was at crowded places like hospital, market. It show "0" exchange since recent update on new display presentation (e.g 0-5). I tried off Bluetooth than on again just capture a few . Plse look into this issue since beginning October 20. Lately it seem that it only captured maybe those arround must be longer than( number of minutes instead of of just passby). It registered lesser in number instead of in hundreds.	2

And it would be interesting to have more personalized data - how many Bluetooth connections made with other phones seems a necessary minimum.	1
11428	downloaded the app from Google play store but failed setting it up as the app says I entered a invalid nric number. reinstalled multiple times and rechecking the nric number numerous times. Still failed.... can someone fix this?	2

11445	This version still not updated. IPHONE App store is alrdy version 2.4 and can check-in group entry.	2
11446	Someone I know said they were feeling 4 symptoms on the app so we could actually see if the app notifies anybody else that they have been in contact with someone experiencing symptoms and over a period of 3 days not a single notification on my app or anyone else that he was in contact with (people he lives with & his collegues) and the HSE hasnt contacted him either. So to sum up in my personal experience this app is to make everyone feel safe, but when actually tested will fail.	1
11447	i tried to log in the app but its showing that "ID card expired", my id is expiring on July -26-2020. could u pls hlp me to fix this.	2

11485	The app worked well but I noticed at times when I was out that no checks had been made. I did recieve an alert to isolate for 14 days which I did, yet on the 5th day into isolation I got another notification saying that I've been exposed and have to isolate for 14 days. I hadn't left to house, I didnt even leave my bedroom so I'm not sure how accurate this app is which is why I removed it.	2
11486	This app is so invasive on privacy, why it access all your phones functions when app says only bluetooth is required. It drains so much power too on old phones. Please fix your app.	2

11489	Hi. I've had to remove the app as it was causing my battery to run down and heat up. Only happened recently after I applied an update to my phone OS from Samsung. Am going to try and reinstall to see if it will work again, but not a happy bunny... ??	1
11490	Doesn't work !!	2
11491	Good	0
11492	This app was working fine until today 9th June morning. But it prompted for an update. Even after updating it still showed that an update is required. Since there was no other option I re-installed the app. But it never works after that. I am wondering how do go out tomorrow. Even for work. Any solution?	2
11493	force close	2
11494	As of today, it wants me to turn location data on or it won't work. Has never asked for this before.	2
11495	I'm happy to do my bit, but I hate the screen clutter, the message that gets stuck on my notification bar "CovidSafe is scanning to keep you safe". Can't you get rid of this? I hate clutter on my screen and this will make me delete the app sooner than you would like. I will still turn Bluetooth on when I go out, but as soon as infection rates go down I'll delete the app.	0
11496	Not given OTP, if OTP given then not enough time allowed for input!! Can't confirm if registration is successful!!!	2
11497	This is a discriminate App. That only allows people from the 26* counties of Ireland Download which isn't on and ineffective to say. A shambles the W.H.O and European UNION should have made one for every citizen in Europe and we are all connected. NOW THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE . Very Silly . We have a European Government to do things like this and they couldn't have came up with a European Covid-19 Tracker . Seriously. Citizens of the North left out again .	1

11500	Finally gave in an downloaded this. Had to copy my code to add and all downhill since then. Can’t access any alpha or numerical keyboard to enter info. Two weeks to respond to this problem is failure in my books even though some update seem to fix the issue and I was able to add visits manually within 24hrs if loading it. So mixed feelings on benefits	1
11501	Useless app	1
11502	I was a bit wary using this app for the first time but they have a secure login system where you can use photo ID to grant the app access to you NHS medical records. Once connected it was super easy to order meds, keep everything up to date and view previous medical inputs on your file. Very very handy and I got my meds as swiftly as I would ordering on my Drs website. :)	0

11504	Very intersting and mind blowing application it's future and funcations is very well??	0
11505	Would love to do anything extra to help with tracing and controlling the spread of the virus but this app sucks the guts out of my battery and majorly interferes with other Bluetooth connections I have to my phone which are non negotiable so unfortunately I'll be uninstalling until I read these issues have been addressed. Poorly designed around such simple factors and functions, beggars belief!!	1

Call up hotline 109 and the customer service told me to change number. The apps only accept the same number 3 times more then that it will not allowed to register. For this issue i have bought 4 simcard. What kind of apps only accept 3 times to register using same number? This is nonsense. The customer service is not helpful at all they can't do anything on the spot.	2
11533	It draining battery	1
11534	While I download the app on bluetooth for whole day but 0 exchange whereas all my frens hv so many exchange. Bern trying to reinstall n install back also same problem	2

11538	Downloaded on day one and think it is a fantastic idea but ended up ordering a new phone due to battery drain and phone overheating so badly that it was to hot to touch. Since found out this was due to your app.	1

11544	Good initiative. Works well.	0
11545	The app runs quietly in the background which is appreciated but the battery drain is too high. It is not practical for the general population to maintain apps on their devices which drain such large amounts of battery life.	1

11578	I want this app to work but I have to take battery back ups to go shopping for 2 hours, that's if it doesn't crash or freeze up. I think this is an important app, confused why it's completely hopeless. Needs a dramatic overhaul for the people that actually use and need it for work.	2
11579	Awesome!! This app is very useful, convenient and very easy to use.	0
11580	When I unlock my phone the app's icon in the notification area is a triangle with an exclamation mark in it then after about a second it changes to the shield with the Bluetooth symbol in it, this is suggesting to me that the app may not be running when my phone is locked.	2
11581	very good	0
11582	When login using NRIC, it indicated only require name and NRIC number. The date of birth and date of issue not required to key in. But if don't key in these 2 information, system refused to let you proceed. Scam app, give incorrect instruction.	2
11583	After updating the app. There seems to be an issue with scanning. I can't scan to check in at all.	2
11584	Its interfering with all bluetooth connect devices	2

11599	I first reviewed the app in June. Three and five months later and nothing has changed. The app has deactivated 3 times in a space of 2 hours. The last time whilst I've been out. I have to uninstall then reinstall. My Bluetooth is left on all the time, so that isn't the problem. What is the point of it ???	1
11600	I downloaded it because doesn't need wifi just bluetooth, I used it for check in entry but one of the guard in a shopping mall stopped me and ask my original IC instead ..	0

11607	3rd Edit:this app not only disturb the sound of bluetooth earpiece but disruptive to games n while watching movies maybe even other tasks or apps.. omg every min the movies will stagger for 3secs thus the sound goes intermittent. Tried uninstall the tracecrap n everything is back to normal. I wonder How much did the gov pay the app dev... for an app that "destroy" a person daily life =_=" seriously im waiting for the bloody token for my family... already got to bare the battery consumption.	2
11608	I think an excellent and useful app and a good idea. I know there are some people who would fear giving data to the government but these are extraordinary times. We all have to do our part to control this thing.	0

11615	In a country that relies on passed down smart phones to its very disappointing and limiting that this necessary app won’t run on iPhone 5 (can’t be upgraded from iOS 12 to iOS 13), which is still an effective smart phone. \n\nThe developers need to look at a way to make it available on iOS 12	2
11616	As of today (13/8) I get alerts that the app isn't active. When I open the app, it decides it's active. When I go into settings, I ensure that it can access location at all times. But I still keep getting this alert. It stops being active when I lock the phone.	1

11620	Like many others had to uninstall app as over last 2 or so days the drain on battery was excessive, from 100 - 30% in 2 hours. No issue up until that and though app was great. Will install again once issue resolved.	1

The app just give me information about that and 3 pieces of advice to stay 1m away etc.. - no detailed map (which area is also red zone other than my current location-- so i can avoid it) - no advice to stay at home during ramadhan - no information service for urgent matters (i know there is call center but why dont they give FAQ in the app) - if i'm in the red zone what i've to do?	0

11651	Does not detect cases in my barangay/district. I am in a barangay with high covid 19 incidence. For a gov't backed app, you're not doing enough to recruit more users! From 500k last month to just 800k? that's a very thin data set you got there. At least try to actively get more people to sign-up and not just rely on referrals.	1

11653	Have tried IT, Fr and DE Corona Apps - this one is the best. Puts responsibility with the citizen to inform gov and protect themselves and societies.	0
11654	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0

11675	I appreciate the use of technology to combat this pandemic. But the implementation is nothing near to perfect. My app status still stays yellow even though, I finish quarantine last week. Follow up calls to 109/16000 is of little help. I tried to clean data, reinstall app etc, finally to exceed my registration limitation. I then had to use a diff no: to register again as 109 cannot reset my count. I cannot join my job & can't go out due to this. Hope tech team can iron out issues soon	1
11676	Not working after last update...	1

11686	Note:Bluetooth tends to drain phone battery if used for long periods on top other apps Areas of improvement: perhaps the check in and check out function for safe entry can be incorporated so we can see existing check in locations and allow us to via app scan to check in. N remotely check out without needing to rescan	2
11687	Hi, Now able to receive SMS OTP, thanks. (Hi, please rectify following problem: -After installing this app, when I use Singpass, request SMS OTP, unable to receive SMS (no response even after several request to resend). -Try to disable bluetooth, unable to receive. -Able to receive SMS OTP only after force stop this app.)	2

11814	Why isn't this app open source ? What information is the app reporting to your servers ? Why is the app asking for location permission and not just Bluetooth for contact-tracing ?	2

11817	\ud83d\ude21The bluetooth keeps disconnecting and connecting when in a crowded area. Causing interruptions to music listening or phone calls when phones that has only Bluetooth connection available for headphones. \ud83d\ude21 \u26a0\ufe0fNeed to have an option to disable use of bluetooth for the app for Ppl that have collected to the trace together token.	2
11818	This is the most boring app I have.	1
11819	Couldnt load user information	1
11820	Would the software be burnt into a chip and incorporate into a handband? If it could - then distribute the handband to all Singaporean and make it mandatory to wear it when leaving the house. No point of wasting time and energy in solving the bluetooth interference with headphones, etc.... The objective is to trace 'closed contact'. It is the effectiveness that counts and it must be abled to seperate data measured at 1 metre distance, 2 metre distance, 3 metre distance, etc..to 10 metre	2

11823	I re-install the app because it keeps on logging, consume too much battery on my phone and drained it and for some reason I cannot access the app. When I try to log in it says that "Error Requesting OTP.. Try again". I tried to log in several times but it won't work. I hope the app developer resolve this issue thank you.	1

11838	How does the info get into the phones ? Does it require the person who tested positive to VOLUNTARILY enter it in their phone with the app? No ones doing that. If they test positive public health or the government should be able to enter it automatically through that persons carrier.\n\nNo one who tests positive is entering it.	1

11862	It does not tell you if you're nearby people with symptoms so that's false advertisement for starts, second of all, nobody wants to waste their battery with bluetooth on 24/7. This app is just so pointless and does literally nothing	2
11863	It's very frustrating that you cannot register with your number from day one. it always tell me to register with the number which I never use.. even calling several times to customer support they says check after sometime but no result..	1

11870	Seems fine and not much battery drain. However, can't say if it works and if it's efficient since too few people have installed the app. Welcome to the new era where Emocracy rhymes with Trumpidity of the mass.	0
11871	Drains too much battery	1
11872	Completely ruined my battery. Since downloading my battery drops a percentage by the minute, even faster if my phone is in use. Even when not in use and data/Bluetooth is turned off, my battery drains itself. Have uninstalled but am still now facing battery issues.	1
11873	Totally STUPID App... It doesn't specify zone wise number of corona patients and hiw soneone will know if there's anyone infected nearby him. Data provided in this app can be accessible by normal web browsing.. on the other hand, this app is obly usable by those mobile users who have only Bluetooth and GPS access at their mobile... What a joke.... I'm utterly surprised and immediately uninstalled the app...	1
11874	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0
11875	At first it was good . But now whenever i open the app it shows "403 forbidden" . I tried reinstalling it and also rebooted the device but still nothing happened .	2

11880	This is now a super app, not just for community tracking. It also has great info and up-to-date county stats. Back in action now (August 11) after a google/android glitch. Just to be sure it doesn't drain battery, clear cache on google play services. All is good, and help yourself and your community by installing.	0
11881	I had to uninstall the app as my battery was draining monstrously fast (had to completely recharge my phone 3 times in 24 hours). Will install back once I know this problem has been sorted as it is unfeasable to not have a reliable battery when out and about.	1
11882	In this time of pandemic applications like this is really needed. We can report our health conditions easily and scan if there are any confirmed cases in the area. I recommend to all Filipinos to use this app so we can help each other to prevent from being infected. This is modern bayanihan. Salute to the team who developed this! Lets all stay safe!	0
11883	BAD SERVICE	1

11918	Interface should be improved.I hope new features will be added soon	1
11919	App drains battery too quickly (59% to 53% in 15min of idle) and keeps phone warm when idle on a tabletop. I don't mind helping the government, but not at the expense of my phone's longevity... EDIT: Developer has replied that drain is marginally greater on phones with Bluetooth enabled. But in the first place, your phone's Bluetooth should not be turned on all the time if you you want to save battery!	1

11936	Really good looking app, displays information well. Unfortunately does not work on older iPhones but that i suspect is down to classic Apple strategies.	0
11937	Why does this application breach private information? I understand location and Bluetooth, but why pictures and phone contacts? And if I decline the software crashes.	1
11938	Battery drains my phone's battery very quickly for the past 2 days. My ASUS ROG phone 2 which has almost 6000mah and running on Android 10, drained from 88% to 12% within 7 hrs in sleep mode.	1
11939	Says my number is invalid, and it is Monday night - 24hrs+ since go live ... yet I just phoned my number and it works perfectly... what's the fix please...such a demotivator when the app falls over at the very first step! I've tried - mutie times. That's it. Hopeless. Won't be trying again. Waste of my time trying to set up. Aust. Govt .. you'll have to trace me through other means.... FIX: turn off Wifi... My phone number now valid and I've registered.	2

11961	The safe entry barcode doesnt work at all	2
11962	Keeps stopping for no reason. Reinstalling it or clearing the application data allows it to respawn but it will go down again a few days later. It seems problems are linked to accessing the Bluetooth stack as when BT is turned off the app will work again. But it will crash as soon as I want to reactivate it with BT turned back on. Frustrating.	2

11972	After providing mobile number for verifications, the words \u2018wrong number?\u2019 shows up. These words wrongly send the message to people that they\u2019ve entered the wrong number but it\u2019s only asking if you\u2019ve entered wrong number. This needs to be changed to \u2018didn\u2019t receive code?\u2019   I had to explain that to someone so that may be why people are thinking they can\u2019t verify their number. If you receive a code it means your phone number is verified.	2

12061	The app should be installed to at least 80-90% of the population to be effective. A better publicity campaign and easier to understand privacy explanations might be helpful.	0

12063	Use full app	0
12064	Do you want to stay safe and alive and help our elderly population. If you have nothing to hide then there it's a great app. It's all about keeping Australia safe. Short term pain for long term gain.	0
12065	This is such a wonderful initiative. It was fast and easy to register, and now the app is working silently in the background to help protect me and my community. Contact tracing is absolutely necessary for the containment of this virus. Thank you!	0

12080	It was working well when I first installed it around October but now, everytime I try to use it, the app crashes (already reinstalled it thinking it will get fixed -but still crashes). More annoying than useful really considering it's the preferred contact tracing app here where I live. ??????	1
12081	I am not even able to log in as they reject my IC number. How would I use it when it does not even allow me to register. Any why does it require so much personal info.	2
12082	Battery killer. Was working fine, up until yesterday, with no affect on battery. Now it is destroying my battery, using it all up in a few hours. Tried uninstalling & reinstalling, but hasn't fixed it. App is unusable until this is fixed. Which, considering the point of the app, is sub optimal, to say the least.	1

12113	I salute the technological prowess of the Israelis.

12139	If you are getting an 'invalid number' error, don't try adding the leading zero it won't fix the problem, INSTEAD turn off your WIFI and use cellular data. You can turn your WIFI back on once the registration is complete	2
12140	This is great initiative. I would suggest to publish info about number of installations, to show how much people use the app. This should build more trust. In Google store it just 500k for now, not that much compare to country population.	2
12141	0 star.. So many huawei user complain about tracetogether app, but nothing been work out by the team. Now government force everyone to use tracetogether app, but as huawei user we are force to collect the tracetogether token. The worst is now the collection have been postponed and cause us not able to collect. I urge ur team, please do something on it. Please do not ignore huawei user. This message wil serve as prove to show authority if they check my phone have no install tracetogether app.	2
12142	Having problems checking in on establishments with error that the qr code is not recognizeable. Tried to reinstall and then was able to checkin. But now I am not able to checkout. The app says there is no internet connection even though I am connected to wifi or using data.	2
12143	It was unable to scan QR code for 1 day, any update should trial before release, as it impact the whole nation.	2
12144	Everything was working fine until I needed to use bluetooth in my car. It wouldn't connect, then found it wouldn't connect on any other bluetooth device until I uninstalled tha app. I am using a Note 8.	0

12149	First off, a very great effort by GovTech! This is such a sorely needed app by everyone right now to help with contact tracing of COVID-19 cases. Already tried the app, and it's great! Very un-intrusive and mainly runs in the Background. Really great for me especially since I'm using Bluetooth Earphones daily anyway. Good job GovTech, and let's defeat COVID-19 together!	0
12150	Easy to install. Save a life. Download the app	0
12151	Great app that keeps your privacy private and help you contribute to make canada a little bit safer. I strongly suggest you download it!!!	0
12152	Very laggy and drains my phone's battery extraordinarily rapidly. This insufferable app has repeatedly cut off or otherwise completely stopped music I listen to through Bluetooth. Please improve this app asap as I have to download it for school next year.	1
12153	I've uninstalled the Covid tracker - it's on my business phone, which is where I need it and i lost business when phone power completely drained & phone automatically switched off.	1
12154	I understand the importance of the app and am comfortable with the privacy precautions even though I would agree there are definitely concerns about data collection. For the moment though I think it\u2019s an important public health and safety tool in the current situation.   When I downloaded it I assumed it would have an option to run in the background if allowed so I didn\u2019t have to have it open all the time. This doesn\u2019t seem to be the case but I don\u2019t mind that too much, I just have to keep remembering to open it again.   However, the main issue is that every time I open it or even if it\u2019s been open for a while it seems to go inactive and makes me sign up and reactivate again which is very impractical and inefficient. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. Otherwise it seems to work fine.	0
12155	sent two e-mail never reply. ic bar code doesn't work is it fixed? 2) doesn't it makan battery?	2

12176	Can we have the app scan the safe entry QR code instead of letting others scan me. Its redundant to have my nric barcode on app when I already have it in my wallet. Preferably I would like to have a very close range bluetooth or nfc where I can tap in & tap out using the app.	2

12282	I downloaded the app on July 31 and then received an alert on August 4 that I was near someone within the last 14 days, for at least 15 minutes, who tested positive. Since the app had only been released for a few days, and whomever I was near who had tested positive, would have had to indicate so in the app, in this case, would the time period only be since July 31? The time stamp in the Exposure log, indicates a matched key count at 3:06 pm on August 4. That’s the only match in my log. I was at home at that time and nobody else in my household had the app installed. I’m also curious about the indication of being close (within 2 meters) to someone for at least 15 minutes. That’s a long time and would assume that someone who had reported being positive in the app would not be out and about anyway, unless they have no conscience. I got tested August 5 and have been self-isolating since while waiting for my results. Appreciate any feedback you can provide.	1

12324	Nearly 24 hours after its release and it failed in the registration process. Keeps saying my mobile number is invalid	2
12325	Like many others...invalid number...but found issue is with internet service ie Wi-Fi..used data and then registerd OK....A PAIN. !!!!	2

12329	Worst and disgusting application need to download and share my personal details forecufully....third class government who wants to steal data by creating thrid class application	1
12330	You are not asking if people already had Covid-19 (confirmed, suspected, no). It would be a good info to collect.	0
12331	The app is quick and easy to use. I am however 8 days waiting for someone to call me and inform me what day I was in contact with a covid positive. The self isolation continues as advised.	0
12332	Great idea but is causing bluetooth issues when streaming music to headphones. Audio constantly cuts out since installing app on Samsung S9. Bluetooth audio issue was fixed once app was deleted.	0
12333	The only reason to install the app is to be notified about the infection around. If the app does not send the push notifications, but you have to enter it to check that, it makes this app completely useless!	2
12334	It's an important app that everyone in France should install. My only complaint is the permanent status bar notification from the app, it's very unnecessary.	0
12335	Easy to install. Works ok. For an app financed by belgian authorities I would have expected a multilingual (Fr, Nl, G) interface... This will increase adoption rate !	0
12336	I may tell you some lines 1 wash your hands at 20 seconds 2use face mask while you are out 3use gloves while you are out No .4 this is not a tip but it's good thing also help poor people and needy . Would you follow these steps?	1

12339	my battery life has been draining faster than other apps even though the app is only running in the background.	1
12340	A useless application that the Singapore Government trying very hard to enforce the citizens to install if the citizens want country to be in phase 3 mode. Quite likely the application was developed by some highly ranked individually or someone related to one such that the application must not be allowed to have low usage or download rate which would deem the application as a failure and a waste of public funds.	1

12347	This was advice apps to download to check the status of Covid test results BUT unluckily the pop up message "your credentials is wrong". From the beggining of getting schedule to SEHA for the test I've used the same phone number and register to my EID. So, it is confusing, while feeling worried on that result. Any other option to know the result?	1
12348	Very nice	0
12349	Its perfect other than that the bracelet never worked even though it has been scanned at the airport and also again by me, other than that it's a great app done in short notice.	0

12351	i give it one \ud83c\udf1f the app is helpful in terms of MOI health monitoring, but again work on the crashes " the app has stopped". some of us aren't allowed to access our accomodations without the app. Today may be working but tomorrow crashed. please work on it. EVERYBODY IS COMPLAINING ON THE APP CRASHING, WHY DON'T YOU WORK ON IT AND MAKE OUR OPERATIONS EASIER	0
12352	Draining to the battery as app keep running in the background. Overall useless, just keep to the safe entry instead of a need to "trace" everyone.	1

12392	The app has caused battery to overheat and go from 100% to 0 in 5 hrs. Its such a pity because its doing a good job. Ive had to delete it. As soon as I deleted app problem disappeared	1

12395	Should have a function to detect version level between mobile device's and GooglePlay's. So we don't waste time re-updating our app when we encounter a corrupted QR code which directs us to do so.	2
12396	I couldnt able to set this up for the first time. All the while it throws me Temprorily Unavailable please try later. Its been a month I'm trying to setup. Please fix this.	2
12397	Is 3.4 version available for android phones? Iphone has this latest version that allows group check-in that is similar to the singpass ap.	2

12406	It looks a great app, the only reason I've felt need to knock off 1 star was as has been mentioned in other reviews already, the app was near impossible to find. Took long enough time to find it and it was more by luck. Even by going through the link in the covid ni app and using link there came up as error. by typing in the name of this app correctly it still wouldn't appear. Actually found it by typing in stop and scrolling and scrolling. Needs to appear easier.	0

12408	Nothing positive comes from this app and all it does is run down the battery!	1
12409	Not sure is my device problem or this app, while this app is on my bluetooth earpiece always will have interruption, after delete this app the bluetooth earpiece become normal	2
12410	I installed this app as soon as possible, it works fine while I'm home or at the local shop or visiting family, but as soon as I venture to any shopping centre, which is the only place I go that I may be in contact with an infected person, the bluetooth cuts out every time, really it's not worth having on my phone.	0
12411	I don't like	0
12412	Good concept but Poor execution. I am unable to Register using my phone, when others with the Same model and Version of the Software can. Reinstalled several times, Cleared all Caches and Settings, Bluetooth On and Off....tried everything but you have NO Help options either Here or on your Website. Given the Necessity of the App and the expected/required usage for Public Health reasons, it needs better Support.	0

12416	Hi, Come out a fix so that even non SG users whose Google Play has been set overseas able to download this app. Now my workplace,many problems, non-sg citizens whose GP is overseas country registered can't download due to prompt that the country in use must be SG. Thks	2
12417	It was working ok. Of late it shows me total contacts of 50 out of which 42 are those whose health status is not known. After repeated uploading of data on govt servers and syncing there is no change and 42 contacts remain unknown health status. Seems some problem with the app. I have updated version installed. My handset is Red mi note 5 Pro.	0
12418	When I key my IC number it always stated its invalid.	2
12419	Pointless app. Use google map ok? Or app like pokemon go it uses Earth GPS to track location and movement which is better than this app?	1

12428	Not working!	2
12429	This app would be good if it worked. However the last time it generated a check was 9 days ago. Nothing has changed in my settings since this date and bluetooth etc all running as required. I don't have faith this app is reliable. **update - I had deleted and reinstalled the app, which fixed the problem. However, yet again app has stopped working so having to delete again.	2
12430	Force Close	2
12431	in my opinion, after I install this application I can immediately assess this application as a garbage application with reason, this application takes a lot of battery, many features that need to be activated, including GPS, one of which is famous as the largest consumer resource and damaging my network connections. I will no longer think about installing this application back on my device until it can run more efficiently in terms of battery consumption, connectivity and resource consumption.	1
12432	I just finished my 14 days quarantine and my etheraz still not coming green ..I called customer service more than 10 times doing what they want me to do reinstall clear cash etc etc..until I exceed limit of OTP but still not turning green..this makes me stressful since I need to get back to work already..this app is no good...	1

12439	Brilliant idea to restrict the spread of the virus. Is 15 minutes contact per event too long? The likelihood of virus transfer between passersby in a much shorter time is not insignificant . But then again it would be too intrusive. What we have is the best compromise. Peter Robson	0
12440	Very lousy app... can't even receive OTP...If not an efficient app, pls do not get Singapore citizens to download such silly and inefficient app. Tks	2
12441	It absolutely drained my phone's battery and also clashed with my Fitbit's Bluetooth :(	1
12442	Unfortunately i had to delete the App today my phone started running hot ever since i downloaded it but today my phone started to badly overheat and started warning me that the covid app was using too much battery, and getting cpu usage warnings. Also the graph in the app is next to useless and no way to compare previous days figures i get better stats from Google. After deletion my phone is working perfect again and not melting in my pocket. I want to do my bit but i dont want to brick my phone	1

12444	Waste storage space drain my battery. Company tell us to download to support govt so i download lor.	1
12445	Great idea, but fatal flaw is that it relies on government humans to intervene. Should be much simpler. Someone identifies in the app that they tested positive and all phones that have been in contact with that phone in past 14 days should be notified. I don't trust these bureaucrats to do this effectively and efficiently	0
12446	Privacy Alert!	2
12447	Such a massive $2 million fail. I can't even get it to register on a 2 year old phone. No wonder the govt has stopped spruiking it - they know it's a waste of time.	1

12521	Again an app designed by morons. If you use bt, why need all the personal data? PDPA says only ask for the personal data you need for the task at hand. Is the government not bound to its own laws? Seems like. And then you have to keep bt on and running this monster in background - but you still have to scan into each and every location you enter??? You guys actually understand WHY you added the bt feature??? Seems not. Embarrasing.	2

12525	What started out well has gone in the wrong direction. Can't even register now - keeps saying wrong OTP. Tedious to set up and intrusive, asks for IC date of issue (for what? Not necessary until I've been exposed.) On top of all this I ask myself why I even bother, when this app won't work properly on my friends' iPhones and they've all refused to use it. To Govt and GovTech... can you PLEASE just make use of the Apple/Google COVID-19 framework which is a much more efficient solution.	2

12541	good movement by the government, but please try to do something abt the battery consumption. I don't mind if u add an option that let's me indicate I'm home, then scans only half hourly and then actively if I have movement more than 50meters, and option to indicate im out of the house etc	1

12582	Won't work on my Galaxy S4 (10/10/20). Just followed prompt to update app (11/12/20) AND IT STILL DOESN'T WORK....!!	2
12583	It is a really helpful app keeping you safe from Covid19	0
12584	Informative	0
12585	Keeps saying my phone number is invalid	2
12586	Very good top rate ????????????	0
12587	The app is very good no doubt but it has a lot of bugs in radius alert	0
12588	Helpful application and we can be safe with the reports provided by this app	0
12589	The concept of this app is good but please fix the requirement that we have to open Bluetooth abd GPS all the time. Espicially for Bluetooth it keeps pop up notification to enable it. It's draining battery + it's uncomfortable to use another app. It should be more user friendly.	1
12590	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0
12591	Nice initiative. 5 stars ... eventhough it has some drawbacks, it helps the community. \ud83d\udc4d Observations : Tracing app is interrupting bluetooth based media devices. For ex: If I am watching a movie on my mobile using jabra evolve 75e, the movie audio gets muted every minute for 2-3 sec. We can not disable tracing when we are at home \ud83d\ude37.	0
12592	Good to be safe than sorry	0
12593	Nice	0
12594	Very very very stupid & fool app.	1
12595	Installed - "GPS must be always on" - deleted it. Claiming privacy first, but requiring GPS to be on to work in combination with Internet access is not privacy. Big Brother / Google - type of privacy is a no go. Btw, for BLE device scan you could have used: "Bluetooth.Adapter.getDefaultAdapter().startDiscovery()" to avoid need for GPS, but you didn't, so it's a conscious choice to violate privacy principles.	1
12596	No one in Japan practices social distancing, even on trains people dont wear masks. This app seems like a waste of time unless people change their habits.	1
12597	I found it easily, I just typed in covid and found the app. But like others have said, when you close the app and open it it says tracing not active then changes to active. Unsure if it is working when the app isn't open.	0
12598	Setup is easy. However, my fitbit seems to stop syncing after setting this up. Does the bluetooth blocks off other devices?	1
12599	I cannot access this apps it's more than hundred times to try,, anyone can help me???	2

12606	I'm on the latest version of the app which is using on average over 50% of my daily battery consumption, my Samsung S20 plus constantly feels warm and I've to charge the phone twice a day to keep up.	1
12607	It is not opening in all mobiles. It should be work in all mobiles.	1
12608	i just bought a new phone & cant register as it say "validation failed"	2
12609	Great app- would love to be able to input where I’ve been manually without the QR code as well to keep track of visiting friends/family and to track before the app was announced.	0

12614	It is best if all shops have auto detect location , so that we need not scan the safe entry when entering a shop, just using trace together will auto detect and check in.	0
12615	My Bluetooth connection are affected So I can't connect to my Bluetooth devices ,Moving forward,my battery is draining . please fix this problem	2
12616	So slow.Waste of time.	1
12617	Useless	1
12618	Seems to be eating my battery .... highest battery usage behind the actual operating system!! If this continues I will have to uninstall	1
12619	The worst app ever!!!! I don't understand the fact of accessing my phone privacy "MEDIA" ??!! and making phone calls if you are making a an app that is helpful for people during this epidemic then make a proper one not something that asks me access to my photos and videos and media in general	1
12620	Excellent	0
12621	Everytime I try to sign into the app it says that it is "Temporarily unavailable" and that "We're really sorry. Please try again later." I have tried many times and yet the same thing shows up.	2
12622	Battery killing app. But why can't it be switched off when you are at home at most times. Interferes with existing bluetooth for driving.	1
12623	Good aaps	0
12624	Best ever experienced in this pandemic situation....	0
12625	The app keeps giving me a message that it is not working try again later for the past 10 hours Please fix these issue	2

12629	Great	0
12630	Crashing all the time, can't use at all	2
12631	Sometimes the app works well and sometimes it does not. Even when my Bluetooth and location are turned on, the app will still prompt me that it is not working. I had tried to update, uninstall and reinstall but it still doesn't work well.	2
12632	Nice	0
12633	Why this app asking for update.its not showing my name.keep asking me update.i check many time in Google it shows open and I open same problem	2
12634	Ok	0
12635	Good tool for good. They just have to protect subscriber's personal data at all level direct, or otherwise to gain more trust.	0
12636	The app isn't loading after giving phone number, and the safe or unsafe option isn't showing.	1
12637	Useless	1

12654	Not sure if my 1st review went through... the app does not recognise my NRIC and i cannot use it. This happened when i reinstall the apps	2
12655	Impossible to install	2
12656	I've been getting daily unknown and private numbers calls since installing this app. Similarly been getting unsolicited whatsapp message to add wechat accounts. It could be incidental to increase in scam activity but i cannot discount that it's attributed to security issues with this app.	2
12657	Evidently, governing authorities have not set this up to work in Alberta. Nice idea. But fails to execute. Shame given how much this technology really could aid the containment.	1
12658	I like it	0
12659	After installing the app the phone kept crashing at random times doing random tasks. With the app removed, phone back to being stable again. iPhone 8, ios13.6	1
12660	The app is hopelessly inadequate. It hijacks/confuses GPS and even my phone does not know where it is. It does not recognize certain phone numbers (mine works, my wife's doesn't, and many of my acquaintances report the same) and after repeated attempts to bring this to the developers' attention they just keep sending FAQs that insult one's intellect., Like, "the app only works with mobile phone numbers" and so on. If this app is our only hope for returning to normal, we are in dire straits.	1

12668	This app drains my battery. I've had to uninstall it which is something I don't want to do.	1
12669	Nice application	0
12670	Finally downloaded it with the return to level 2. It actually does work well and does what it’s meant to. Significantly quicker than handwriting your details everywhere I find. Plus you avoid those ‘dirty’ pens. And majority of businesses seem to be on board with providing QR code’s at the entrance, exit and throughout the interior. Highly recommend	0
12671	good	0
12672	I cant never do the check in using my favourites. I always press and says network error	2
12673	Drains my phone battery like nothing else and can't be easily shut down if you aren't out. How much did this garbage cost to develop.	1

12682	I keep getting an error message that my internet connection has issue, even after i reinstall. But if i use singpass safeentry it works - no internet issue I don't know why TraceTogether safeentry is so unstable. It is convenient - no login process needed unlike singpass mobile but always fails me. I just tried to reinstall, and now it refuses to work - i can't get the otp, it says i have a connection issue but all my other apps work fine and can get to the internet \ud83e\udd15	2
12683	I like the idea of this app, but it's draining my battery to fast, I have a Samsung note 9, which normally lasts 12hrs with heavy use, from full charge at 7.30am to 3% remaining at 12.30pm, that is not acceptable as I have people on my family with health conditions for whom I must be contactable. So I will have to remove the app from my phone. Maybe when the power usage from the bluetooth is sorted out I will reinstall, I normally do leave bluetooth on, so must be the way this app uses it.	1

12685	Massive battery drain causing phone overheat.	1

12687	JUST BRAVO	0
12688	I just change my phone to Huawei P40, now I not able to download this app. Because Huawei don't have Android	2
12689	Ever since I installed this app, I've been having many issues with my phone. The battery drains so quickly and the system lags all the time. I prefer using the SingPass app. Can't this app be removed altogether? It makes no sense to download another app when there is an existing app that works perfectly fine. Kindly look into this so that we can have less issues while dealing with this pandemic. Thanks.	1

12695	Great app that will help us save lives and help the health officials decide on the restrictions. I strongly suggest that people read the help page on the app. Android/Google requires all apps that request access to Bluetooth\u00ae to also obtain location permission. As a result, COVIDSafe on Android asks for location permissions because they are needed for Bluetooth\u00ae permissions. COVIDSafe does not store or use location data on Android. For more information, read the Android developer guide.	0
12696	Causes my Bluetooth earphones to constantly drop out . Took me a while to find the root cause of it man. Thought my earphones was faulty! Bad bad bad	2
12697	Why can I still see my NRIC date of issue in the app? It should be also masked after the app has verified the date of issue. This info can be used to reset a Singpass password.	2
12698	Latest update drains battery all day long.	1

12752	I've been trying to sign up on this app (visitor) as the first step to register on Etamarna. The nationality drop down is not working and it's a required field to complete the registration process thus I wasn't able to continue. It needs to be sorted out.	2
12753	All good now, gave up trying on the first few hours but the next day it has installed OK. Hope this helps manage Covid-19 and get us back to normal as fast as possible.	0

12770	When you click on the “preventive health center” you get a list of numbers for hospitals and health clinics. I have tried to talk to a human being using one of those lines since 11:00 am (it is now 2:20 pm) and no human being picked up (I tried Mubarak, Adan, West Salmiya, Hawally, Amiri, among others). I only get automated responses, or no answer. When I called 151, no one picked up either. Instead I was put on hold with the Quran on playback for 5 minutes until I hung up. It’s a shame that the ministry of health can’t get people to answer phones during this health pandemic. Very bad administrative capacity from the ministry. So far, app is a waste of memory on my phone.\n\n?? ???? ??? ?? ??????? ?? ?? ?????????? ?? ?? ?????????? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ???? ??????: ??? ?? ??? ??????? ??? ??????? ?????????	2

12800	Tried to register and the system said that it was unavailable and to try again later.	2
12801	Buggy as hell. When trying to set up account gets stuck in endless loop of not being able to enter the validation code, or being told your account is already set up, making it impossible to register and use. Emailed the help address and awaiting a response.	2

12803	Note 10 user here. Noticed that google play store unable to update apps and download new apps (showing "download pending" without moving).

12805	Checked today and found that this App has never auto-updated on my Android phone, despite auto-update being on, and working smoothly on all other installed apps.

12828	Tried several times but unable to ge the code. The number provided is correct. Any one else faced this?	2
12829	Useless as unless positive person consents to uploading they are positive, you will never know if you were close contact. What's the point of this . Positive person should be automatically loaded for contact tracing. Uninstalled	1

12839	Why the Bluetooth need to be switched on which makes my device visible to others, Uninstalling!!	2

12841	Good job, guys!\n\n- Would be great to be able to add places you have been to manually without QR code, given not all places will participate or it might be unpractical in places.\n- Would be great to communicate where the data goes and where not more clearly.	0

Many smartwatches already have bluetooth enabled by default and it would be a waste to not make use of such technology for those who have smartwatches. Of course those who do not have smartwatches can use the phone version as well or the token.	2

12879	I like the simplicity of the app. Everything is very useful. However it's been draining my battery like a hungry hippo. Just today it already contributed to 34% of the battery usage. Yesterday night I went to sleep with 100% battery. I woke up and the phone was turned off with 0% battery left. I'm using a Samsung Note10+. I check the diagnostics and this app seems to be causing the trouble. So I'm currently 80% sure that I will uninstall this app soon.	1
12880	Very good aps	0
12881	Useless app with no proper sending of OTP and full of false information.	2
12882	Same as everyone else. Killing my battery. Myself, my husband and our neighbours all have had to uninstall it. Shame as we did have it from day 1. Might re install if issue is fixed.	1
12883	Bad	1
12884	Downloaded the app today, registered my email but the verification code kept being denied. Tried 4 times with new codes and still wouldn’t work. Now won’t let me register again as days “email already exists”, but still won’t let me log in. Tried deleting and reinstalling the app, still won’t work. What a waste of time when I’m trying to do the right thing!	2

12890	The App would occasionally cause interference to my car entertainment system when listening to music from my phone via Bluetooth. This would happen when my car is next to another. The problem goes away after the App is uninstalled. Would briefing great if Developer could look into this matter.	2
12891	Fails to scan QR code, but other similar apps scan ok.\nDoesn’t appear to allow you to manually enter a Business when the QR code fails. \nNeeds more work.	1

12893	Very buggy app. Couldn't get past the registration step. To be expected from the government I suppose.	1
12894	This app: 1. Destroys your phone's battery life. 2. Interferes with bluetooth connections to you car. Since installing this app my car bluetooth connection keeps dropping out and requires constant reconnection. This is dangerous in an emergency. 3. It does not actually work as advertised yet. No contact tracing has happened through the app. What data is this app actually collecting and where is it going?	1
12895	Bluetooth off	1
12896	The most laggy app by far! Only using because it's my civic duty. But seriously, a well funded government should employ a better team to produce a better app.	2

12904	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0

12906	Good initiative but how it will works with Bluetooth & location only? How will be the data will be matched? I don't think so that it is working!! Take a initiative to make it more usefull and avoid forward to browser.	0

12908	Good	0
12909	Rubbish	1
12910	Just as all the other negative reviews mentioned, this app is not working properly. I just returned early this morning and aside from the lack of any kind of courtesy (I was asked to check in 6+ times starting from 9:30am) it requests a check in but when I try, it says "a check in is not required at this time" and I continue to get warning messages to check in before it expires. It's nonsense that these issues have yet to be fixed.	2
12911	Horrible mockery of an app. Bluetooth will drain battery. Apparently, the process requires users to log corona data manually. Most importantly, anything you click on will be prompted to open browser. If that's the case, why not use a browser?	1
12912	Very good	0

12920	Nice and simple app. reminds you when you forget to turn on Bluetooth, which is good. I only turn it on when I leave the house, since there's no point in having it running at home while draining my battery. You can force stop the app to 'turn it off' so it won't drain your battery. Just re-open the app to activate it again.	0
12921	Anyone who got error kill the app and try again	2

12924	I am unable to open the application it stops working Everytime ,shows that some sqllite error I sent the bug report please fix .I cannot use the device	2
12925	Had this installed since it first released. Uninstalled it once briefly because it started messaging with my Bluetooth devices. Seems this has started happening again so it's gone. Don't think this thing is anywhere near as effective as manual contact tracing, and I doubt it would be much use if I were in a hotspot anyway, because I don't know anyone else who is running this.	2
12926	No way of turning it off when you're not outside. Wastes battery power with persistent notifications. Security issues still haven't been fixed	1
12927	There is a few other country that made an app like this! My only other request is to make an Apple Watch app.	0

12929	Issue about bluetooth. I'm starting to see issues about my bluetooth devices cutting out and even dropping connections sometimes. Battery usage has slighty increased. Other than these issues, everything is fine and would you bring dark mode back? Edit: Bluetooth connectivity of my devices are having intermittent drops here and there. No improvement for bluetooth stability at all. Each update is getting worse	2

12968	I like the app and what it's intended for and have used it diligently since installing it. On 8th Aug both my phone and my wifes phone started getting getting hot, losing battery life faster. It's like something got dialled up in the app. I reluctantly disabled it for that reason.	1

13044	Requires location service to be "on" to detect devices near you.. well I'm not going to use the app then. Make it useful with the location setting "off" and I will start to use it. I might not be sharing my location but I do not accept that it needs location access when it is not necessary. Bluetooth works just fine with location service off. I don't care that smittestop doesn't track my movements, but it enforces everyone to turn on location giving Google and other apps access to my location.	1

13066	The pros: - It registers and automatically checks-in really quickly. - Easy-to-use UI. The cons: - Absolute battery vampire. - Interrupts Bluetooth connection to earbuds. (Goodluck yall.

13089	This app wasn't helpful at all I wrote everything about me. my ID NO , everything and it keeps saying no mach ......... like what ? I tried all my family's numbers and it didn't work , but it works with my Turkish friends	2
13090	For once the Gov has done a good job in creating an app which is actually privacy-friendly, with strong legal protections to back it up. As a privacy advocate and software developer, this is the first app from the Gov that I'm actually happy to have installed on my phone.	0

13118	How many millions did they get paid for this useless privacy infringement app? You want my data? Ask google for it. Surveillance at its best. Uninstalled it immediately. Didn't even hesitate. This app is so useless I believe they could have paid 10 k for it in Bangladesh and get the same result. Spend that tax payers money , because we have to much anyways right? Simple solution to COVID ? Open clubs, start events open everything which results in mass infections, second wave ahoi !	1

13139	This app keeps crashing on my samsung s9 plus. This happens 2-3 time a week. This is a problem I have been facing, and probably all other users of newer samsung phones for MONTHS. This is a problem first reported in the summer. And had STILL NOT BEEN FIXED. Despite the imminent huge surge of infections in Iceland. This is absolutely um unequivocally UNACCEPTABLE.	2

13181	Drains battery and my phone hasn't worked properly since I installed it.	1
13182	Drains battery too quickly. Woke up in the morning to find my phone off, battery was drained. When checked what might have cased it to my surprise I found that one of the perpetrators was this app, it used 25% of battery fromm 3am. Needles to say got rid of the app battery behaves normal now.	1
13183	Very good	0
13184	I can't download the app	2
13185	I can't open this app anymore. It keeps on off. I uninstall and installed again stil same. I can't open	2
13186	What many says is true. It drained out the battery like a vampire. It is suprise to see that it won't show in the battery usage. Battery usage in Android will not show this app consumed so much battery. Not sure how the developer bypass/manage to do this. What is even more surprise me is that developer did not address/bother to reply on this issue. Hahaa...	1
13187	Not pleased had to supply card details in order to get app	1
13188	I have been diagnosed with Covid 19 on 14.11.2020 and its status is showing as You are safe. How come this app is showing wrong status and the purpose for which it was used by the government for contact tracing is nullify as it's status is not at all changing.	0
13189	Simple and easy to use. Effective. No issues with data for me. Good work.	0
13190	Hats off to the developers. This app is great and it does not infringe on my privacy. An update to include optional notification reminders to check in would be deadly	0
13191	App drains battery and notification cannot be turned off from app	1
13192	Useless. Battery optimisation disables app, even after following developer instructions. This is a global pandemic, get your act together or let someone else step up! Now says abornmal power consumption. Get ur act together!	1

13196	I am a health care provider, my page turned to purple and it notified me I was exposed. I was really impressed and it worked really fine. I was at that time in the middle of an eclosion. I have been tested now and it turned out negative, and I am in another hospital. I would love to reset my page to green, to be notified again if I am exposed to another source, but the app doesn’t allow me to do it... It would be awesome because now the app is not useful for me at all, because I can’t reset it. I am under the impression the app is a single use only.\nThanks for your help :)	0
13197	Good	0
13198	The idea of such an app is very good, however, the technicalities are poor. The app is draining my phone battery and doesn't work without a permission to obtain access to the gallery and calls, which I am not fine with. Moreover, after installing it, I simply cannot control bluetooth on my phone, even if I switch it off, it lights up the screen and switches the bluetooth on itself....	0

13215	Hi, after recent few updates, I noticed the battery drain on my Samsung s20+ is of a concern. My phone would be at 81% when I go to bed and when I wake up 7 hrs later, the battery would drop to 34%. This is in stand by mode. Please find out the issue.	1

13236	I realized this app is pointless. Because only cautious people download it who do not get infected anyways because they wear mask and wash their hands properly. While the ones that do not give a f.... will not download it and will happily get infected and infect others who do not care about it anyways :D I have it on a few days ago walk a lot around Geneva all day long but not a single warning while there are daily 50 new infections in the city about a month ago.	2

13248	Exilent and useful application	0
13249	Great app. But why must it constantly be displayed in my notifications? Please do not make it display in my notifications constantly.	2
13250	Got a dual sim phone. Both numbers reported as 'invalid' when attempting installation. If this is because of excessive demand, why wasn't this anticipated by the software engineers? And an appropriate error message presented?	2
13251	Pros : 1. One stop management without having to move between apps like camera and Google chrome to check in/out Cons : 1. Drains battery of mobile phone alot faster before installation. 2. Affects stability of bluetooth connections between mobile phone and other devices such as wireless earphones. Connections either hanged or dropped intermittently	1
13252	Qr code scanner does not work... it says network error even if im on mobile data	2
13253	When opening the aap Im getting one button "version update" clicking on it get me to Google play store but here there is no update so I have buttons for uninstall or Open, clicking on Open gets me back to the app where I have only the version update button... So nice idea for an app but its not working.	2
13254	Good job	0
13255	Very good program	0
13256	Cant get my results!!! Sms not come. This app as well not working. It telling that i provide wrong information. How can i get my result?	1
13257	Huge drain on battery, to the point that I have to turn it off while I'm out and about to avoid my phone dying halfway through the day. Which defeats the purpose of the app. Since the last update of the app on my Galaxy s20 the notification prompt which persists is: "covidsafe is not active" although when I open the app is says "covidsafe is active, no further action is required".	1
13258	Worst app ..... This app violates our privacy...	1
13259	5 hours trying to get it to accept my phone number. I give up. Can\u2019t understand how so many have had no problem. Tried with zero in and zero out nothing works.	2

13283	For what is worth, my Samsung phone is showing that the app has been operating in the background for 12 hours, zero minutes active, but used over 12% battery. I've only been out once to an un-crowded local supermarket (no one else at home). The app's never been like this before. I'll need to shut it until this battery demand situation changes.	1
13284	Doesn't work on my Huawei Mate 30 pro without GMS. Why do you need GMS if all other communication app is working fine and if it really only uses bluetooth as clained?	2
13285	Same old problems as the very first version it was released. Different brands of Bluetooth earphones/headphones keep on disconnecting especially in crowded places. Mentioned the first version, till now still the same. Think I go get token better. Give up on this app.	2
13286	Battery draining	1
13287	This is the second time am downloading this app.It keeps on stopping whenever I open and I don't know why.Do something about it because am not the only one complaining.You could cause problem to a labourer.	2

13294	I think it's great to integrate the safe entry to the app. However, as a SAF regular, I'm unable to input My NRIC to the system due to my IC being a 11B, resulting in me being stuck at the front page. Reason? I am not sure of the date of issue of my original Pink NRIC which I've surrendered years ago	0

13302	Absolutely thrashes my battery, on the upside, It's kept me safe from corona	1
13303	Recent update was the worse. I have been using this since launch and had no issue until recent update. The app cannot detect nearby users with bluetooth, and is a battery monster. Have uninstall already.	2
13304	Will not download onto my 1year old state of the art smatphone. Bad, as a user of many android apps what are you thinking. I have found more than 3700 other users that can not use this app. Come on you must no you have problem.	2
13305	Im impressed by their idea, good app everyone had to have it	0
13306	I have the same problem as Ben Parker. My Android keeps turning off the battery optimization setting so the app disables itself after approximately five minutes. Therefore the app is useless to me. I have reinstalled it to no avail. I have an OPPO A73 with up to date software version 7.1.	1
13307	Since I have installed this app, my phone keeps getting disconnected from my cars hands free device. It is a bit annoying. I have to unpair my phone and cars hands free and again pair them up. An urgent fix is needed for this issue. Some of my friends and colleagues also are having the same problem.	1
13308	Battery drain issues have been resolved so the app is back to being brilliant.	1
13309	Hi i cannot log in anymore.its always showing temporary unavailable	2
13310	As with a lot of other users, I am experiencing battery drain with this app. On a nearly new Samsung A70 that would usually last 3-4 days on a charge, now only last almost 24 hours. This app is now uninstalled. Trust is a very important value between developers and users and I am sad to say, you have just lost my trust.	1
13311	Good but it keeps lagging my bluetooth ear buds. Its very very very annoying. So much so as I'm so very tempted to either uninstall or else i have to keep pausing the app (making the app redundant) every time when I'm connected to my ear buds.	2
13312	No message on here	2
13313	Good app surprisingly consume very less battery.	0
13314	Battery drain needs improvement	1
13315	This app is functional and beneficial. However, ever since this has come online, I can't help but notice other devices attempting to connect with mine initiating a passkey authorisation. Now, I know not to authenticate, but I think this may open up new methods for someone with nefarious intentions to gain unauthorised access to devices.	0
13316	Good initiative	0
13317	No straightforward possibility to simply link an existing test like in other apps (like the German app), which scan a QR code of the test just made. Generating the code in the app and making sure the testing centre takes it into account is cumbersome, unreliable or with some testing centres (e.g. Ecolog testing centre at Brussels Airport) plainly impossible!	2
13318	Good aap so acurate	0
13319	Uninstall....affect my tracker..	2
13320	It's a good idea. However I know several young people who believe that the app could be used to track whether they are breaking COVID restrictions so they won't download. Govt should guarantee noone will be prosecuted based on info from the app. Would increase use.	0

13336	Failed to install it on my phone (Galaxy J5) Tried it several times and also checked settings to make sure traking/notification is allowed. But it stops at Message "Well done, Tracking is underway" and goes back to "Install App". No Gps Track sign shows up and according to batteryusage Gps-Tacking is not used. Any Ideas why the Installation failed or how I can check if it works (and why then mysterously not showing up Gps-Tracking?) TIA :-) Ps: Gave it 4*rating, because rating is required and as I can not give a review in lack of working app, I judged after the reviews :-)	2

13353	Sick tech I love it	0
13354	Has anyone else with a Samsung experienced problems with the app & their phone? Woke up this morning to a notification from the app about an update & then my phone, which is new, went from 100% to 38% & hasn't been the same since even though I've tried different things.	1
13355	Wheh getting OTP IT WAS not functioning then i get an errors message, Sigh	2
13356	Drains out battery extremely fast & affect the bluetooth connectivity of other devices, cannot even detect other bluetooth devices at times. Not sure if app works for contact tracing, since it cannot even detect other bluetooth devices at times. However the updated improved version is really significantly better. Kudos to the team hard at work!	1
13357	Battery is draining alot. What is purpose of Bluetooth to be on always.	1
13358	App says it is not working because my location services are off, but my location services are on.	1

13363	Right after I completed an update it seems to affect the app unable to function. It just pops up then I get back to my homescreen.	2
13364	Very good app	0
13365	Very good initiative. But how can we trace a Covid-19 positive person? There is no clear information about how i get alarm when a positive person near me. Why Bluetooth?? I am not sure is the app really work??? Most important is that this app is not found in mobile version play store/IOS.	0
13366	Very good	0
13367	Once it's stable, I'd reconsider installing. The app keeps crashing. I just got to know that I'm in the red zone and infos abt surrounding red zone areas and closest hospital but that's it. Need a whole lot of improvement.	2
13368	So far it works - but you should offer a TL;DR version of the mandatory introduction (the part of "how the app works", which is very clear for technically inclined people, but could deter some by its length and technicality)	0
13369	What is for the people who are in on arrival and business visa they cannot access to the app. Is there any solution for them.	2

But with this app it just drain my battery so badly that I need to off my bluetooth or stop the app from running. Battery percentage was 49% and without doing anything within 45min the battery percentage drop to 39%. How to use sia.	1

13423	Superb	0
13424	This app is killing my battery over the last 24 to 28 hours. Is there a fix on the way. The app is hardly viable if I can't keep my phone on me because it has to charge every 3 hours	1
13425	Mostly working from home so I rarely go out and turn off Bluetooth. The app made my phone heat up like crazy and drained the battery very fast. Options to put app on standby should include 3 and 7 days.	2
13426	Good	0
13427	Same as all the other recent reviews - since the most recent update it's been draining the battery so badly. Phone cant last a few hours of non-use without needing a charge. Samsung S8	1

13454	Nice app	0
13455	Quick and easy to navigate the set up. No issues. A great way to notify you of a suspected/confirmed case of the virus in a place where you have been. That way you know to isolate immediately. Great work to all involved to get this app up and running. I hope more people sign up to this quickly. Well done.	0

13460	Good widgets and well thought shortcuts, but it keeps messing up my bluetooth connection with my airpods. everytime i get into a crowded space it makes my airpods go silent. I have to manually disconnect and reconnect it again. It’s a small issue but it can be slightly annoying at times.\n\nNever had this problem of airpods disconnecting before i installed tracetogether.\n\nPlease have an option to login other family members too. It’s annoying to have to open a whole different app because my grandma doesn't have a phone.	1
13461	Super easy to use. No concerns on privacy, especially in comparison to Google and Facebook. A couple of suggestions: 1. support older Android device as elderly people don't have latest phones. 2. An option to disable the notification.	0
13462	Good very helpful	0
13463	Phone frequently complains about the amount of power this app uses	1
13464	I've been trying to complete my profile but unable to. It keeps on asking to check in the fields as the validation fails. Reinstalling but still the same result. I will have to uninstall for now as it now useless in my phone storage.	2
13465	This covid safe app did not work properly on my phone . It kept turning itself off all the time. I reported this issue several times but I had no response back at all. I end up uninstalling it	1
13466	All I see on home screen is `share thisbapp`. I am not sure how this help. Not user friendly.	1
13467	Closed source and no English translation...	2

13476	This app has been so useless to me for past 1 month. After my third test the app was unable to show the result and keeps showing " couldn't load user data please try again or contact customer support" Tried customer support several times but they are still sleeping to this date. And today after my 4th test the app is still showing the same nonsense message. Tried uninstall install logout login everything but this app is acting like a stubborn jackass. No improvement at all. So disappointed.	1
13477	Never works properly. For a mandatory app and quick rollout to the entire nation you'd think more time and effort would be put into making sure the app and runs properly on all different platforms. Selfie check-in doesn't work and is almosy always bugged. Submission of the check in rarely goes through, and I have to reset the app several times just for it to work. The assistant is absolutely useless, that is if it worked anyways.	2

13495	This app does not show the true death count from Covid lockdown. It does not count the people who died from suicide or people who did not medical help because Covid fear.	2
13496	ok so this app doesnt work if you use tpg as your mobile network bc tpg is not very good and like even though im using it ( bc free ) and tpg lies to their users so change your network and download this again but yes i cldnt get the otp bc of the " invalid " number thing	2
13497	Easy to install. No invasive questions. Edit: Have used since release with no bluetooth or battery issues. The single icon in the status bar is clutter but not annoying.	1

13513	Phone number incorrect	2
13514	Show the government confirmed cases gps location . Atleast we can break the chain of spread that way! We should also be given information of where was the confirmed case last been. That is the only way we can be cautious. Better safe than sorry! I have many confirmed cases in my area but its showing none	2
13515	100 MB download is a lot!	2
13516	App open and running and twice a day I\u2019m getting an alert to open the app and turn my Bluetooth on. It is open and it is on. An important app we should all have but stop beating us over the head with it when we\u2019re already doing the right thing.	1
13517	Dropping to 4 as serious battery drain on version 1.0.1.44 recently. May be related to July 2020 Android 9 update which installed last week. Simple, streamlined and effective. I hope to never get the alert though.	1

13525	It's a nice and useful application. Just wanted to suggest that the term "social distancing" my please be replaced with "physical distancing". We should be Socially Connected but physically distanced. Human beings cannot survive without social connection. Thanks	0
13526	Excellent	0
13527	The idea is good and people should download it, but my bluetooth has stopped working since I downloaded it, even after I uninstalled it. My phone is now probably stuck in 'Bluetooth Low Energy' mode and won't work for music streaming anymore. Please correct this. I know the app had to be made in a hurry, but still... It pisses me off.	2
13528	Does not work properly	2

13534	Hi! I have updated my tracetogether app last week, keying in my nric no. But today i have change to a new phone. When i try to set up again, it said my nric no is invalid. What should i do?	2
13535	I think it's a great principle, but I suspect its having a significant negative effect on my battery life.	1
13536	why allowed to share my personal photos and information!? and why i have to accept that any updates inside the app soon without my acceptance will be? how also will know that people infected or no without test, for example im healthy then i found it not green then I'll shock?, why phone drain battery means there something recording with me everywhere not comfortable	1
13537	Good	0
13538	Latest update caused huge battery drain - 10% per hour according to battery usage bout l but in the phone settings. Please fix it, previously battery usage was around 5% per day. Currently the app is unusable due to that battery drain.	1
13539	Very slow	1
13540	Great efforts from Ministry of Health. Given that everybody has a phone these days this is something extremely simple that can save lives! The government has delivered and now it is our turn to spread the word. This effort only works if many people are using it. So please help to recommend this app to as many people as possible. @Developers: Seems to me you have developed a very good app that is fully scalable. Please also think in the global context and offer this to other countries.	0
13541	Installed the app. Unable to get the security code to confirm the phone number. App returns: "invalid phone number" . I assure you that I entered my number correctly. I always expect problems when using a government online facility. And guess what, here we go again.	2

13547	Terrible app. Deleted before because it drained battery said they fixed it. Do i installed it again 2 days ago and all it does is drain the battery. It has updated the national breakdown in the todays I had it.	1
13548	It ask me for update and it hanged. Then, I uninstalled it today morning and I am tried to install it again but I can't till now.	2

13551	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0
13552	It's the first time that I actually really disappointed with an apps. Apps with great purpose but with limited capacity. Not working at all, always said there no internet connection when actually my internet connection work just fine. when i actually got log in, in just several second i got log out with a notif "this apps keep stopping". Please fix the apps, and please don't recommend people to use it when this apps isn't working. It's added unneeded stress	1

13557	This is frustrating. The app just refuses to validate my particulars. I have no idea what's wrong with my name and nric. It just keeps saying validation fail.	2
13558	Older version did not work, but after uninstall/reinstall it works fine :) gj	1
13559	Last day cases were delayed by a day or two. Today it shows my 31 July (it's 16th October)	1

13561	Works. Easy to download and register	0
13562	So far, I'm not facing any issues with transferring with Bluetooth or with my wireless earpiece as some of the users here. It's all good. Really good initiative to run this. I hope more people will adopt. I hear people saying that the gov might use our info....but we are already giving big companies like Facebook, Instagram and etc our data willingly. Talk about irony.	0
13563	The app is burning through my battery power today, I've had to recharge twice - I can normally go 2 days on a single charge. For a public health perspective I don't want to delete but my phone is useless using battery power at this rate......	1
13564	Definitely should be downloaded. It is missing a few key elements one of which is the inability to dive down further into each county where potential hotspots might be. This information should be included in the app (considering we are being asked to volunteer this information anyway rather than lumped into a particular county. The app doesn't function properly without location services turned on anyway) Right now it's only half as effective as it could be.	0

13585	Battery killer	1
13586	I am happy to hear that it was technology that was produced in Ontario that was able to make this app possible.  Furthermore, the fact that the app does that use data or the phones gps allows my children, and others, who do not have data on their phones to have access to the same security. The use of the Bluetooth remarkably!  Everyone has a public duty to help slow the spread.  Please do your part.	0

Please improve public awareness!\n\nin the meantime, please let your friends, family, and colleagues know :)	0

Observed this apps turns off by itself, i tried restart the apps but it keep flashing Tracetogether keeps stopping. Had to reinstall this apps to get it working again. This app also block adding new bluetooth device. I had to unistall this app so that i can add new device. Unfortunately i was forced to install it due to company requirement. This is really a badly designed apps.	1
13605	Phone became warmer while on idle and hoter while in use . It drain my battery faster than charging it. App does not close or stop and run at background. It will interrupt your internet connections so often, have to Force stop it. It interrupt other GPS oriented App. At the end, I uninstall it... Power Hog.	1
13606	Why its asking for access to data including pictures? And you can't enter anywhere without it so you have to install it.	1
13607	It does the job. I'd like a notification reminder. Most times I don't check in cause I went to bed just past midnight. If it were the kind of notif where you can also just press "no symptoms" from the notification itself that'd be very convenient and easy to use. Imo, don't force a notification on people - let them opt in.	2
13608	Perfecrly behaved. No issues no loss of data or battery	0
13609	Great. Loved the initiative and also the fact that it takes very little space. ðŸ‘�ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜Š	0
13610	Are there numbers available to let us know how many people are using that app? So that we know, that the purpose of this app uses its full potential ,otherwise I'm just going to uninstall it again since it's using so much battery power.	1
13611	My COVIDSafe registration, PIN etc have now disappeared and I need to start over again. I did not request it to stop working. Problem seems to be my Malwarebytes anti malware protection which may perceive this COVIDsafe app as a malware threat and attack it. I want both Malwarebytes and COVIDSafe to continue as good apps to have. Can a way be found for them to coexist on my mobile phone at same time?	1

13618	I changed to a new phone. I installed the app on my phone and want to re_register tracetogether onto it. However, i am unable to register my NRIC. Do advise.	2
13619	This app is making my battery draining faster than usual. Also, when I connect my earpods with my bluetooth on, my music gets interrupted as it gets very choppy. I didn't know what was causing it to be choppy till I deleted this app from my phone and everything is back to normal. I would rather use the token instead.	1
13620	Worst experience ever. For all works Like symptoms check or something, I have to go to an external website.. If I have to go to external website then what is the use of this app? Worst ever. I will never recommend anyone to download this app.	1
13621	Bad	1

13634	Downloaded the apps but cannot get the one -time password (otp) Doesn't even receive any of the otp at all.	2
13635	Got this app to participate and assist in making Canada safe.  But as is usual with Canadian Federal Government.... they think only one province exists... Ontario.\n\nI have to say, I changed my “Province” to all available and the only province with reporting capability was Ontario. \n\nYou would think that developers of something like this would have at least studied High School geography.  Or maybe even Elementary School level.  I learned about Canadian provinces other than Ontario in grade school... not sure where Trudeau went. \n\nOntario <> Canada \n\nDeleting App now.  No point in participating unless I am ignoring travel recommendations and visiting Ottawa.\n\nTry again... maybe think a bit bigger than your tiny little corner of the country.	1

13649	Update Nov 2020: Uninstalled due to battery drain and overheating on a Galaxy S10 5G. Too risky to leave installed. No issues on Galaxy A30. Down to 4 stars. Original Review: Zero issues. Works as intended. Some initial issues with Bluetooth streaming audio but these are easily overcome with updates and firmware updates on speakers. Original review 5 stars.	1

13684	NOTE to those experiencing battery drain, you can FIX this by a) installing this app, b) clearing Google Play Services cache, c) restarting your phone, then d) reinstalling this app. Over the last few days my phone battery was getting slaughtered just like everyone else's; after completing these steps, this app is back to using a fraction of a percent	1
13685	Bad App Drains battery like a plughole Has no useful stats which also are not up to date	1
13686	I really like the idea of this app if it actually worked... But it doesn't. It continually pops up notifications telling me it's not connected because my Location isn't open when it clearly is. I've also now noticed that even though I have selected Auto Update so I will get the most recent numbers it's not updating either. Example: NSW has been showing most recent number as 14 new cases for days & I had just seen the Premier's speech for today & we have 4 new cases. Even allowing for 24hour turnaround that is still wrong. I'll be interested to see homuch longer we are consistently getting 14 new cases per day. C'mon techs we expect much better than this when you pushed so hard for everyone to download this app. There's no point in having it that I can see. If anyone knows a Web page that simply gives current updates per area searched please help me as I'm in the very high risk category & would like to be aware if/when there's new cases to be aware of. Thanks everyone it sure looks to me like the online community will be more help to me than the official govt app at this point. Unless of course they put the effort in to have it work properly because short of a miracle we are stuck with this virus for the forseeable future &ppossibly beyond.	0
13687	Is a great app. Handy to have when out and about. I like how it informs you if you knock bluetooth off. However wish there was a notification to check in every day as I tend to forget	0
13688	Was running perfect. But from 8th Aug phone began to overheat and battery drained constantly. Had to uninstall.. ??	1
13689	With the massive battery hog, this isn't even good for contact tracing. You can't really use it once your phone is flat because of having this running now can you. And I'm sure some people around me don't appreciate suddenly hearing my music out loud because of the bluetooth connection dropping.	1
13690	Superb app	0
13691	Good one but all stats depends on user self declaration so little weird to know that there are +ve cases in our area when none idenitfied. Hope to see good results/feedback in future as the generations are changingðŸ‘�	0

13700	The reason I rate this app a 1 * is that it's completely disconnected from my experience with the real world!! When you go to do your grocery shopping you want to be in and out as fast as possible to ensure minimizing social interactions. This app is useless. What it needs urgently is the ability to scan the QR code so that we can get in and out of stores. The stores are not equipped to scan the provided bar code and as a result they don't even offer check out. => Pointless app.	1

13709	Has the app been fixed My phone was hot and battery draining within a couple of hrs Says here last update 15 July	1
13710	I really want to use this app as it is a great idea. However since installing it, I've had nothing but issues with my phone, issues with updating important apps for work, even battery life is messed up. App can't work without an alive phone, and phone can't stay alive if said app drains it of all power before it has a chance to do anyone any good. So it's a no for me regarding the installation of this app. I stick to what we have been doing since this all started. Keep distance and wash hands.	0

I installed the app on my wife's phone in few minutes.	1

13858	As with many other reviews, I have the error message with wrong number which is unrelated to me at all.	0
13859	Good	0
13860	Date of birth isn't written	2
13861	Simple and easy to use. Could do with daily notifications to remind you to check-in. And would be useful with more historical data to look at specific case numbers per day.	0
13862	Not useful as it was advertised	1
13863	Excellent	0
13864	Useless	1
13865	Won't recognise my phone number says invalid. Have tried 2 ways. Without first 0 and with. Useless	2
13866	Trying to enter the pin the app texts you is incredibly annoying. The app closes every time you try to open your texts to see the pin resulting in you needing to re-enter your details and start again with a new pin then repeating again and again. I ended up circumventing this bug but it really shouldn't be that hard in the first place \ud83d\ude44.	1
13867	So far so good. I will get tested in due time and will upload my result to the app, so that it can do it's job by upping the game on contact tracing.	0
13868	My phone battery drained very rapidly and I was quickly out of battery on a long hike. There was almost a search party sent out to look for me cos I was late getting back and no-one could contact me.	1
13869	simple an safe	0
13870	gd	0
13871	I like the idea of this app but it is buggy. First of all since installing the app my phone now gets very hot and the battery drains extremely quickly. Also the app interferes with my Bluetooth headphones and keeps interrupting it every minute or so for 5 to 10 seconds. That is very annoying. The bugs need to be ironed out.	0
13872	Great idea but eats up my phone's battery like no tomorrow, which considering its point is to somewhat monitor someone's surroundings, it's a pretty big deal if it eats up your battery life as a dead phone won't keep anyone safe.	0
13873	Verification sms does not match to login	2
13874	The app is automatically forced close so I can't use this apps. Please fix it.	2
13875	Unable to download this app. My phone is Samsung J7 pro. Tks.	2
13876	Maybe a diary to write where you've been would be more effective and greater awareness of our movements in the community.	2
13877	Eassy and helpull .thank you..alhosan uae	0
13878	Good apps	0
13879	Good	0
13880	Good for health indicator	0
13881	Dear All, plz confirm if this app is working outside UAE or not? For me it is just showing first loading page only.	1
13882	While the Covid Safe app is running, it interrupts music playing through Bluetooth every minute or so when in the car. Music stops and starts again constantly. This has happpened in two differrent cars with two different phones.	0
13883	App is always giving an error on selecting the location.	2
13884	Statee that my NRIC is wrong and couldn't log in at all, please assist..	2
13885	We were sold a 70 million dollar lie and I will be the first to admit that I I got conned. I guess the Dopey Dan Victorian debacle highlights this in hindsight. What a sad waste of taxpayers money	1
13886	Keeps saying my phone is an invalid mobile nb. Can't even register.	1
13887	Nice	0
13888	Worst	1
13889	Great	0
13890	Can the app start by itself when ever I turn on the phone? Can the notification run in the background	2
13891	*Edited because it deserves a good rating. Its actualy a great help for everyonen. Thanks for the info. It keeps the bluetooth access open all the time. Why??\ud83d\ude14	2
13892	I don't know why this Bluetooth is always ON after when I installed this Ehteraz	1
13893	When i tap my debit card at the shop i walk out and cry she burnt my village. I turn on covid safe and come good thanks government. .\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude00	0
13894	latest update doesn't detect nearby phones anymore. not even my 4 colleagues standing next to me.	2
13895	It is good, but how it is possible if you out of czechia and change your region and not be able to download something equally for the other country. That should be not happen in the EU and is for me just another example how the EU works for the people living in it.	0
13896	Not only is it a hassle to try to get this poor excuse of an app to work (i spent a good portion of an hour just trying to register as either the code didnt come or there was no blank to enter the code) it also links location settings to bluetooth so that when you turn on the location, bluetooth is also automatically turned on EVEN WHEN NOT USING THE APP! Im not even counting the fact that the app itself has a myriad of bugs but im already at the character limit.	1
13897	Good although we don't want our lockdown can you take it out of place because it will spread covid-19 quicker and covid-19 need to have app if they do not then you will be coming home with covid-19	0
13898	Seems good, doesn't drain my battery. It would be good to see the app show how many daily cases in each state, not just the total of all states.	0
13899	High battery usage in the last few days. May have to uninstall until an update is pushed out. Users having issues can try this fix. Your milage may vary, but uninstall Covid Tracker app. Goto Google Play Services app settings and clear the app's cache. Restart phone and reinstall Covid Tracker.	1
13900	easy to install. no issues finding it on play store.. I used link from DoH.	0
13901	Four attempts and still not registered	1
13902	All good until I get to the Mobile Phone section where it will not recognise and send me a pin.	2
13903	I am coming from canada. I was told I need to download this app. I want to know how to get OTP if I don't own any india number. Out of curiosity I want to know how to use internet at the airport. That requires OTP with indian mobile number. Dec06/2020 I am sure I have not explained rocket science so you canâ€™t understand. As simple as if I canâ€™t use international number to start the app how am I supposed to use it.	2
13904	Good	0
13905	Good	0
13906	It's a faulty app and doesn't match with patient's symptoms	1
13907	Stupid app????	1
13908	Battery use is ridiculously high. I'm going to have to remove if it's not fixed soon.	1
13909	App is useful for contact tracing. However, why do you not allow group check in yet make the function available. Please make this available when you are bringing babies to the polyclinic yet you need physical ID to scan in. This is increasing touch point which is defeats the original idea of reducing touch point	2
13910	Why must on location and bluetooth to use the app. Drains the batt very fast. Possible for government tracking also.	1
13911	Great app, well done. Would recommend a daily notification that prompts you to do the daily check in.	0
13912	The app is great and easy to register and it will really help trace who's caught the disease and it will help me if I've been exposed to someone with the disease. BUT the always-on notification in my status bar is super annoying, I don't need to be constantly told that I turned it on because I already know that, please stop cluttering up my status bar. When you get rid of that always-on notification I will give you five stars.	0
13913	Good	0
13914	A red herring. App does not stay in background despite following instructions to give permissions on my Huawei P30. There has to be a better solution in such times	2
13915	with good intentions, and lots of potentials, but user experience is bad, maybe the version update. hope to fix soon..	0
13916	Much easier to check in n out of facilities / establishments	0
13917	Sahi he what	0
13918	Very good	0
13919	Currently, this only works for those of us with a telco subscription. Would be useful for those transient or work permit workers who don't subscribe to the aforementioned service but are dependent on wifi for their wechat, line or whatsapp communication using their mobile devices. Pls offer this in Chinese too.	2
13920	Pls remove the notification that always shows on the notification bar. It's very annoying.	2
13921	Unable to Put in my student pass NRIC.it keeps on saying that it's temporary Unavailable. troubling for me as I have to take my Student card out everytime even when I'm carrying things	2
13922	Updated: I downloaded a later version of the app and was able to authenticate without issues, so all good now. Unable to load video as Camcorder goes to files only	0
13923	Good	0
13924	The app doesn't let me verify my NRIC even though I checked every number/letter	2
13925	Great app. Maybe add a decimal for the symptoms. I would imagine its 99.9% Feeling Good and not 99%.	0
13926	Nice Software	0
13927	A very good app for tracing and stopping coronavirus	0
13928	I don't like having to agree to "battery optimiser"	1
13929	I took my test last week, i already recieved a text notification of the result of my covid test, but On the apps, it says "test is not available"	2
13930	After update, the app asking for a lot of sensitive personal data. Is this app really from SG Gov? Y cant we use singpass to login? Dont feel comfortable after the news of fake app and key-in so many personal data.	2
13931	updated the apps and decided to uninstall it due to collection of more info than expected. dont mind providing ic number and phone number. but extremely uncomfortable to key in birthdate and date of issue.	2
13932	Let's all use it and stop covid19	0
13933	Very good app.	0
13934	Filled in the NRIC field but app can't tell it's filled. Rubbish.	1
13935	Digital Bangladesh. Digitally handle Covid-19 properly inshAllah.	0
13936	When I woke up and pick up my phone from charging station early in the morning, this app already clocked in more than 25 exchanges. Looks like such a dumb app that records every single exchanges, not only wasting phone resources, but potentially collecting unnecessary data. Extrapolating such massive data can indirectly reveal much more information than the necessary relevant contact tracing info. The safeentry module is redundant when token is introduced at each shops.	1
13937	Keeps saying my phone number is invalid. Cant complete	2
13938	Keep saying that it's the incorrect QR code	2

13946	Error while registration, date of birth is not updating.	2
13947	After downloading and setup the apps, my iPhone 11 Pro installed with IOS 13.5.1 keep feeling warm and my phone camera flash keep deactivated. \n\nSince day one, in-order to protect my phone battery, I had turn on the optimize battery charging in the battery function. After installing this trace together app my battery won’t charge more than 80% due to high temperature. \n\nAfter I deleted the app everything goes back to normal. \n\nHow are we going to support government roll out measure when your apps is giving problem.	1

13970	Government should do something about all the safarshi and incompetence people working in these government departments. This is one of the most badly designed apps ever.	1
13971	it crushes Huawei phone system by active the mistouch prevention function all the time- if you hv turned this function up,u hv to uninstal this app of unlock your phone manually by pushing Volume up and power key and sliding up the screen all at the same time.	2
13972	.my concern is this apps makes your phone slow, lag and sometimes it is annoying,i do hope they can fixed it.	2
13973	A very relevant tool in this kind of trying time that will help every filipino to be aware in his surroundings. Install this app and stay safe.	0
13974	I downloaded the app as soon as we were able to. Last Wednesday I got notified that I had been exposed and to go for testing or self isolate. I was surprised as I have maintained a small bubble. I waited three hours to get tested and when I got into the test centre the notification was gone from my app. It now says that my app has not been exposed. The test centre were considering not testing me. I am very confused on whether I was exposed or not. Whether I need to self isolate or be tested. Now I expect to get another notification as I was three hours with a bunch of people being tested. I called Health Canada and they had no answer. I am considering deleting the app as I am not sure if it is working.	1

13979	Not able to receive OTP	2
13980	Need some repairs	1
13981	Good idea but crucial notification for status is still missing. It seems to work as intented but the design is not with actual users in mind. There is no indication on the status of the application running in the background. This leads to me forgetting turning it on and/or off as I have no idea without opening the app. Also there are too many steps to turn it on (3 taps is a lot).	2
13982	When i download the i cannot login to the app ,please solve this issue and let me know what is the solution for it	2
13983	Its 11th September. Just installed latest version. By County only shows 8th September? Why is it always few days behind?	0
13984	A very useful App that can help our government to monitor Filipinoes health conditions. Big salute to developer GOD Bless po?????	0
13985	NIC devs, this app is not getting installed only on my phone lol!! So its fine with me, as I did not wished to share my details to the Emperor of India and his fatso advisor. I know you guys will be coming back to my review with one of your standard reply.. I don't give a fish to that!	2
13986	Good	0
13987	The idea is Nice, people need to register so that it will be useful.	2
13988	Easy to install. Works ok. For an app financed by belgian authorities I would have expected a multilingual (Fr, Nl, G) interface... This will increase adoption rate !	0

14000	Not working.. Can't choose nationality	2
14001	Seldom does any checks, I've uninstalled resintallled and checked all settings and always have the Bluetooth on, yet the checks are still sparse and intermittent. No confidence that this works.	2
14002	Easy for me \ud83d\ude01	0
14003	Will not let me put in my mobile number. It says Invalid number. Have tried installing it from Wi Fi and also Data. Uninstalled it and Installed it several times.	1
14004	Runs down batt much too fast	1
14005	Has made my S9 infuriatingly slow, even a lag when typing messages! This app needs work if they want us all to have it on our phones coz I'm ready to delete it.	1
14006	This app will not help stop the spread. Its only a tools for tracking people who were in nearby or contact with the one that is infected. The only way to protect individual is to behave what a doctor in the hospital did. Wear mask and keep your hand sanitizer before and after. Eg before boarding train, entering supermarket. & sanitize after coming out of the places. If everybody does it it will be a double protection. Imagine the contact tracing people also down with the virus, whats the point?	1
14007	Terrible. I got to send money and the app had a question mark. A waste of uber. Called customer service and it's still not working.	1
14008	Nice	1

14017	Good	0
14018	The app didn't notify me of risky encounter, I have checked my phone settings for this app and it should notify me. If I wouldn't open it randomly, I wouldn't even know I had a risky encounter, twice!	1
14019	Would be good to have a 2h or 4h reminder if we are still in the premises as we may forget to check out! If we are still in the premises, we can just disregard and swipe the notification away so it is not too troublesome for us	0
14020	The versions > 2.x work OK.	0
14021	Started draining the battery	1
14022	good	0
14023	Not working	2
14024	Would be much more useful if the county breakdown was of the same day as the case count instead of being 2~3 days behind. Otherwise its alright	1
14025	This app is power hungry and when everyone is under circuit breaker there is not much contact to trace anyway.	1
14026	No matter what time of day l try, l cannot download it. It just keeps going around & around, without download happening	1

14032	App is stuck on a blank screen, no other options appear...	1
14033	Before it was working fine but now its not opening also	1
14034	Other than a drain on battery, this is a pretty simple app. Bundle together with SafeEntry, it's very useful. Would be great if we can do a offline SafeEntry so that it still works in the event of network outage.	1
14035	Crashes everytime since the last update. Cannot be used at all.	2
14036	The app stops working when accepting the T&C. I have Android version 5 (lollipop). I can't register or do anything after the screen of T&C.	2
14037	The app doesn't work at all.	1

14042	Pointless waste of tax!!!!!	1
14043	Update: 20/12/20 Battery drainage is still terrible. Still can login multiple devices with one mobile number. 30/11/20 When I sign in the same number on a new phone, all my Favourites does not port over from the profile/account of the old phone, and all my saved Favourites are gone. And when I sign in the same mobile number on a new phone, the old phone does not auto sign out, meaning I could scan 2 or more different places at the same time, with the multiple same Profile/NRIC.	1

14069	When I downlaod the app and wanted to set up the app with my particular, i.e. name, IC no. . . The app will validated and respond that my IC no is wrong despite it is the correct data. I had done loading the app and repeat the set up process at least 4 times and still face the same problem. As for the OTP, it is the same too. Even though I had entered the correct OTP, the app still validated and said that the erong OTP had been entered. It is really fustrating depsite I had tried and tried.	2

14081	Not able to go pass login	2
14082	When you register for the app, the system will send you an OTP. The first OTP regardless if you typed in correctly or not will fail. Only on second OTP the registration will pass. Entering your birth and NRIC issue date, regardless of what year you typed in, it will default to "1970" after you accept it. It is only when you scroll to your birth year or NRIC issue year manually, then it will be correct. Do you guys check your work? This will cause massive data entry errors on your app.	2

14089	So far so good. 4 stars because I would prefer the option of being able to turn off the bluetooth and location permissions whenever I'm not out in public. I have turned Bluetooth off but there is a constant notification telling me it's turned off and I can't clear the notification off the screen. Considering that most of the time I am at home I don't think I need to have the app activated at all times.	0
14090	QR code scan missing.	2
14091	I am very grateful for all the efforts Bahrain govt has made to make its citizens and residents safe. God bless our leadership and people for all your efforts and care to keep us safe and protected.	0
14092	They said it does not require location services. After recent update, does not work without location services "on". Very supportive of the government and the purpose of the app, but I don't allow any app to use my location services unless it is necessary for the use of the app. Your location is not required for the purpose of the app, especially when the government said that it does use your location.	1

14106	refuses to send the pin. have tried with and without preceding zero, turned off wifi, uninstalled/reinstalled. android 9, nokia. now the real question: how many registrations have been successful compared to the number of downloads (not including reinstalls)? it will eventually need an app notification reminder to register for all the unregistered devices once the bugs have been fixed.	2
14107	Responsible, in conjunction with Google Play Services, for huge battery drain and phone overheating issues on multiple devices over the last 24 hours. Will need to uninstall if they continue.	1

14300	In reply to the developers, I hope this helps. My mobile is Samsung Note 20 and using sony wf-1000xm3 for my Bluetooth earpiece. I am beginning to feel that other brands might also be facing the same thing. This means Trace together is lagging or cutting off the sound. If you don't do something, these major brands might start questioning if their customers have to choose between the earpiece or trace together. Hope you can do something. I had shared what....	2

14341	Constant app icon in notifications bar is not helpful and annoying. Should just pop up if the app stops working. I don't need to constantly know whether the app is running. Since close contact requires more than 30 minutes contact. Scan interval can be reduced to help with battery draw. If it kills my phone while I'm out, it also defeats the purpose of the app	2
14342	Keeping me informed ???? thanks for letting me know	0
14343	Given that this app essentially never has screen time I would have thought it would be painless to use, however it's a battery killer. On my year old iPhone 11 pro it consumes 27% of my battery. Which is twice as much as the next nearest app. Since I started using it this summer. I thought it was perhaps an anomaly from earlier versions so I reinstalled a month or so ago.   It didn't take it long to move back to the number 1 battery using app at 27%. I'll keep using it since it serves a good public purpose, but I would appreciate it more if it was more efficient. Thanks for your efforts.	1

14361	The app provides very limited information, it notified me that I was in contact with a confirmed case in a place I never was (and would probably never go) but there is no way to click on the location and just see it on a map. Only after checking on Google maps and finding the location was a few kilometers from my home was I absolutely sure that it was a mistake.	1

I am facing the same issue as the rest of rhe people on this review side and i hope they fix it cuz of the obligatory purpose this has that it needs to be shown to every store people have to go to... so why not expand the services on this app and not have such limitations either for the people and for the help desk... we both cannot do anything for this "Exceeded limit of attempt" and other related issues.	1

14420	I have been using this app from last 3 weeks and have not witnessed any battery issue, as stated by fellow users. The battery consumption is around 1-2% for entire day when I start the day with full charge. This is important for our own well being, so no complains whatsoever.	0
14421	Didn't detect my daughter as a close contact to an infected student, even though she had the app. The school alerted us to that fact. Pointless app if it fails to detect close contacts. Id give it 0 if I could.	1

14432	Very good	0
14433	I don't feel comfortable with this App forcing me to give permission to everything all my contacts media and photos. This is so wrong on so many levels. You can have my location but my storage? Really? Zero privacy. Please fix this issue because it's not right. What about my rights and my privacy?	2
14434	Great App....	0

14450	Nice apps	0
14451	Wow	0
14452	The app does not track your location. It keeps a log of all the phones you have been near for last 21 days. It does not upload this information unless you give the permission; and you are only asked to do so in the event someone you had contact with is infected. When you uninstall the app, all the data on your phone are deleted. As restrictions ease, clusters of outbreaks will happen. Effective contact tracing is the only way to localise these clusters. Otherwise, everyone get locked down again.	2
14453	we don't need for exchange anonymised. unistalled.	2
14454	There is a constant push notification 24/7 to tell you that the ap is running, quite annoying. The government is constantly tooting their horn about how many people have downloaded the app, but this doesn't reflect how many people are still using it.	2
14455	I tried to login with my student pass but it say temporary unavailable ? I have been everyday but the same problem say temporary unavailable	2

I was not able to go to work because the security barred me from entering. I even showed my sms message confirming I was negative and showed the HMC certificate showing the quarantine period yet it was disregarded because they only follow the Ehteraz status. I called the Ehteraz hotline and daily you kept saying it will be updated "tomorrow". Your tomorrow lasted for a week	1
14474	After update suppose to allow student to register but it is not working. That way by selecting NRIC works. Thanks.	2
14475	Tried to out my mobile phone number in, (yes, with and without the zero), however it says that my phone number is invalid. Cannot get past that step, no matter how many times I retry.	2
14476	Useless app.	1
14477	No OTP received.	2
14478	Best if can add qr scanning safe entry to it. Then we can just scan in and scan out rather than scan to go web to submit and nobody scan out. Just like office punch card. The app is running all the time might as well add some functionality to it.	2
14479	A third class app. This will warn you only if someone have Arogya setu app in phone installed and Bluetooth and gps is on. What happened if someone off the Bluetooth and GPS or not allowed app to use Bluetooth and gps. Also how many people in India have smart phone. My father still use 800 rs phone. Useless app.	1

14488	Excellent app and very useful. It was nice adding the capability for the app to automatically detect updates and alert the user. Now you don't have to manually check for updates. It would also be nice to link all paper permits to the app. Some of the dependents do not life with the household and the app should take that into consideration. It should also take into consideration laborers living with the household but are not on his kafalah such as maids on contract through labour service offices.	0

14542	Further improvement needed to minimise drainage of battery. The app is on 24/7 in the background to constantly check whether it is active. I need not to turn it on while inside my home to safe on battery power.

14602	Most of the people doesn't know about this app and data is updated after one day during which most of the things have been already changed...And testing is far less than being said on news channel.. So Adios.	2
14603	I was using this app from when it was first available. After a few days I noticed my Samsung Note 9 (with all the latest software/firmware etc...) not being able to download apps from app store or updating existing apps. Apps would get to 99% and just freeze and not install. I reset my phone to factory default twice only to discover the fault would return once the phone was restored with the same apps. I noticed on the second data reset I activated the COVID app first then, whilst setting the phone back up to it's usual operation, I wasn't able to connect to my Smart watch via bluetooth or my bluetooth headset. When I deactivated the COVID app I was able to connect to these devices. When I deleted the COVID app I was able to download and update apps from Play Store. I like the concept of the app but not if it blocks my notifications and causes my phone not to operate correctly. My wife has it installed on Note 10 and all seems fine.	1

14630	Useless radius information. The only different feature about this app does not work.	2
14631	Each time I tried to install the app, it is unsuccessful in its setup when I am supposed to get an OTP. the error message is network connection.	2
14632	Not working	2
14633	Goal is great, execution lacking. Or maybe testing. Crashes my Bluetooth every few hours. 'I'm Alive' notification disappears quickly. Have battery optimisation off for this app. Get to work debugging... I need to reboot Android every few hours at this rate. And I need to get out of this lockdown.	0
14634	Dependent on bluetooth connectivity too much for this app to have it constantly crashing. Always disconnecting from other devices. Uninstalling this app until reviews advise it's working better	1
14635	My malaysian cousins who are staying with me in SG couldn't download the app. it says "\u6b64\u5546\u54c1\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u60a8\u6240\u5728\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6/\u5730\u533a\u8d2d\u4e70\u6216\u4e0b\u8f7d" or translate to "the app cannot be bought/downloaded in your country"	2
14636	Not helpful at all!!! Not reliable because the confirm cases declared by lfu is always 0 ..... So meaning no cases of covid anywhere? And it always need an update (app) very annoying but no difference at all!! I think it's a trap bec if you put your health status and it's not in good condition? I think I think they will put you as probable .... Uninstall this app ...and never download it again!	1

14643	I'm editing my previous review as I think I might have been quite unfair with the view that it consumed a lot of my battery. I use it only when I am out and I force-stop it when I'm home. I think an ability to easily put the app to sleep would make it a better app. Thank you to the team for attending to my review!	0
14644	nice	0
14645	Thought it may drain my battery but it's been fine. Updated the app! I hope everyone gets onboard!	1
14646	I like how it doesn't assume you have (or want) internet access and geolocation turned on, and I can keep those turned off to maximise privacy from every other (often uninstallable) personal data hungry app on the phone.	2
14647	I installed it even before it hit the news. Cannot remember how I knew about it but then I’m always googling. Yesterday I got my first alert that I have been near somebody that is infected. This is a brilliant app! Thank you Drpt of Health fur moving quickly with this. It’s a very valuable tool.	0

14665	Not everyone has a phone that supports the most recent OS.	2
14666	Cool in theory, but needs changes to work in practice. I had to update my phone just to download the app. It’s only available in English and French. Many of the people at the highest risk of getting COVID-19 are immigrants or the elderly - many of whom do not have phones released in the past 5 years, and many of whom do not speak English or French as their first language. This app needs to be available for as many people as possible in order for it to work properly, otherwise many infected people will not be able to report their diagnoses. This means getting support from lower iOS levels and adding new languages - Mandarin, Cantonese, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Punjabi, just to name a few. Many people I know wouldn’t be able to use this app for those reasons, putting themselves and others in danger. Disappointing.	2

14685	Covid safe app is great	0
14686	Easy install. I always have Bluetooth off unless connected to headphones, so breaking that habit will be difficult. This doesn't work unless Bluetooth is on. Anyone with privacy concerns, none here, but I hope you have turned of GPS location tracking. I'm not sure those people who are concerned about privacy are even aware their location data is being tracked and stored. See Google Maps TimeLine, which I use. Personally I would favor a more aggressive contact tracing app for the case of Corona.	0

14708	COVID19 app is useless. It doesn't work or do a damn thing. It's not worth installing on your mobile device. As one reviewer quoted, it just drains your battery life.	1
14709	Doesnt work at all.	2
14710	The concept is a good idea in theory. I only turn my wifi on when I leave home so I have not experienced any battery issues with my Galaxy S10 5G device. I don't believe any state or territory has been able to read any data being produced by this app yet, therefore it's difficult to know if the app is actually working?	0

14717	Very simple user interface, and a great tool for the Nation to continue to fight this virus. Everybody should do their bit and use it. Excellent approach, no centralised database, and using only bluetooth anonymously to track interactions. The data protection statements are in simple plain English, and with the source code publicly available it's an example of best practice in transparency. Ireland is one of the World leaders in Covid-19 response, and this is another tool in our toolkit.	0

14720	I already registered on the web base staysafe.ph and used facebook on my registration. This app followed so i downloaded it. When trying to login the choice of loging using facebook is not an option now. No other choice but to use mobile number to login. Unforetunately my password is not working on this app. I made sure of this by trying to login on the web base using my password and it works fine. I also tried multiple times to make sure I input my password correctly. This is a dead end.	2
14721	This is very good apps	0
14722	Battery drain .. went from 38 hours battery to max 4. Removed app and all sorted.	1

14724	the aap is not working properly it says to sign in and when i try to it says already checked in. please fix the issue. also provide an authentic number so we can tell our problems.	2
14725	until the latest update, this app was a 4. now I would give it 1. it now disconnects my Bluetooth devices every few minutes which is extremely annoying when you are in the middle of a phone call with Bluetooth headset on.	1
14726	Why is it now saying I have to allow location for Bluetooth to work on my Android phone? I've never wished Google to know my location and why would that be needed for Bluetooth? I have been happy running this app for months but now very tempted to uninstall it.	2

14790	It keeps interfering with any additional bluetooth device that I connect to when running this app. For example, if I connect to a bluetooth speaker or to my car for hands-free and maps, it drops me out every 15min or so, losing connection and having to re-start everything manually again. It will suddenly cut out any calls, music or maps directions. Would be great if this was fixed so we can keep running it in the background without interruptions.	1
14791	I cannot get through , keep saying my phone number is invalid..........I come back to get pin number go back my details are gone. I don't understand, could this be fixed, other people don't have this problem. There phone number they go straight through. Please help.....	2

14934	This app is redundant and it's only purpose is to help drain your battery faster, now electrical bills very expensive you know?

14992	Difficult to find in the PlayStore. Other than that easy to install, easy to register, compact and succinct in its messages.

15011	Registration pain. Won't register phone number unless wifi is off. PIN has to be entered as separate numbers, new one needed before trying to remember and type it in. Very frustrating.	2
15012	I understand the importance of this app to get the COVID outbreak under control, and am happy to install it (well it's mandatory), but it's too intrusive for a contact tracing app. It's not logical that an app to track locations would require access to make calls, as well as to the phone gallery/storage. Puts an insane amount of strain on the phone resources including the battery leading to overheating, and significantly quick power drain.	0
15013	Good one	0
15014	Wow?? This app is very great and it's future is very intersting i like it very much Thankyou devolper...?	0
15015	I've had to take this app off my phone for the 2nd time due to how quickly it runs down the battery. This time my phone was also incredibly hot and I assumed it had just reached the end of its life (it's a Samsung, 3.5 yrs old). Then I came across comments online about this app, battery life and making your phone over heat. I deleted it and my phone is fine again! I'm hopeless with technology but can anyone give some tips on how I can reinstall without the battery and over heating issues?	1
15016	Very nice to use..its helpful	0

15018	You\u2019re willing to give up \u201cfreedoms\u201d to giant US tech corporations who where you have very little recourse, but you\u2019re worried about an update that collects not even half the data.   Get real, download it and move onto your next Netflix binge.	0
15019	very good.joy sri ram	0
15020	I am having problems downloading this app.I am using Samsung Note 10+.	2
15021	Updated just recently but after few days BUGS still kept happening. Please fix your app we're compromising our status especially there are checkpoints. I just bought a new phone for this! Update: 14/7 - This past few days, every now and then the app shows "QUESTION MARK" again, it's really annoying every time you go inside a establishment that ask you to show your Etheraz then it will just show a question mark. It's either you will open through the playstore or u need to uninstall/install it.	2
15022	Today don't show bar code	2
15023	Excellent. Simple to use with up to date statistics.	0
15024	So annoying I deleted it. Wouldn't allow my phone to Bluetooth to my car or any devices. Even with the update it was terrible. My sanity won out against protecting the community and I deleted it.	1
15025	This should be compulsory for Coronavirus period.	0
15026	Although a good idea, this messes up my wifi connection at home. It constantly disconnects and re connects wifi making it unstable. It also constantly crashes my Mercedes Me app which is really annoying.	0
15027	Battery drain very fast and my phone get hit after a certain period. Bad for the phone	1
15028	This stupid app does not work at all. I emailed and asked for help but still does not work. Apparently it would be my fault if I don't use this problematic app. Seriously guys... fix this if this is a mandatory app that you want people to use this for the Singapore's government sake.	2
15029	good	0
15030	Eats battery. Halves usage time. Pauses Bluetooth transmission every couple of minutes so can not listen to music or podcasts	1
15031	My phone is in English. But this app forces the language to English and not give an option to switch to the French version. When I click "Activate TousAntiCovid" it loads for 15 seconds before timing out and telling me that I don't have Internet (I do, I tried many times)	2

15038	Why the French are deleting contact-tracing app? Nearly half a million French people uninstalled StopCovid contact-tracing app soon after downloading it. This app has alerted just 14 users about their potential exposure over the course of the last three weeks. That's despite France recording many new cases of the virus every day.	1
15039	Great thanks easy to use	0
15040	The apps is good but the battery is drained I have to keep my phone the whole day on pawer bank to keep on charging. Plus it's not supported by wifi. It has to be accessed for all kind of network to keep up the update tracking. Please fixed it	1
15041	It's absolutely brilliant and fantastic stay safe ph and very nice and I recommend to all to all download this application	0
15042	Great idea but I'm really unsure of its effectiveness. Its usefulness depends entirely on people who have tested positive and who have downloaded the app and who have registered themselves as positive and who also go around the city and who have their Bluetooth and location on all the time and you as the user always having battery drain nng location and Bluetooth on... So the % of times all of those factors coincide make it unlikely to provide much actual use unless enough people use it properl.	2
15043	Very good, what is needed	0
15044	No English for an app created to avoid a virus spread in a global pandemic. I guess only Finns live in Finland. Well done.	0
15045	Very good aap	0
15046	Frustrating. If you want people to use it make sure it works first. Won't accept my phone number.	2
15047	Very happy they incorporate the group login feature. Useful for kids n parents. Stay safe!	0
15048	I was one of the people who download stop covid, but didn't keep it on my phone because my phone couldn't support the Bluetooth low energy mode. So seeing there was a new app, I download it too, but my phone is still not compatible with this app. However it should be a problem to work on in the future, because I think I'm not the only one who has a phone not compatible. But of I've seen, it's quite a good app tho, still better than stop covid.	1

15056	Assuming that the developers of this app did not intend that gps has to be switched on all the time, this does not shed a good light on Google. Disappointing. Update 12.2020: Unglaublich wie umsetzungsschwach unsere Verwaltung ist. Peinlich.	2
15057	Samsung S5 Gt-19507 smart mobile phone cannot download this app. Must be millions of Australians with the similar issues.	2
15058	Installed easily on Samsung S10 and runs in the background even if you close apps. Everyone should download. Apple and Google know more about you than this app even will so stop with the whole privacy thing, get over it you are nothing special so just downloaded so we can all move on from corona	1
15059	Why can't the apps incorporate safe entry like Sing Pass with QR quote and can checkout without having to scan again so that we don't need to use different apps to do same thing.	2

15070	Untrusted App	1
15071	Seems pretty good. Does consume battery. I initially had issues because installing on a phone set with English as the language caused the activation to fail. It seems that issue was fixed quickly (a day or two) and now it works fine. Glad to have this now I'm going back out occasionally.	1

15082	Latest version always stuck at registration page dispite keying in all the data as per my ic. Useless.	2
15083	Shocking app. I had to abandon the registering part of the app due to a connection issue. When I tried to complete the registration part I had to go through the whole rigmarole.

15094	I have an Oppo phone, have turned off all battery optimisation options but this app drops out after about 10 minutes. I have to continually remember to turn it on. I should not have to think about whether it is on or off when I am out of the house.	1
15095	The battery drain issue happens again after patch update. This is totally unacceptable.	1
15096	When it 1st launch, this app doesn't drain battery as it indicate. After the new update on the 8th June 20. It drain my battery extremely fast then usual. Development team, do take a deeper look into this. Thanks.	2
15097	It's application is useless and each & every central government undertaking office to forces everyone to download this app.	1
15098	Not any phone can use this app?.. P40 pro can't use?	2
15099	Good initiative but poor in terms of the value it gives to the user. Another Sgsecure?	0
15100	Great for keeping everyone safe and aware if they come into close contact with covid positive people we all need to have this app for everyones safety especially the elderly ????	1
15101	Worst corona app ever. Doesn't work at all on iOS. Needs major improvements, especially to user interface and the ability to login.	1
15102	registration failed app not working too much problem I try to register more than 5-6 time but not register and I receive it the message something went wrong please try again every time like this coming message	2

15107	This is not a bad review for the sake of it, here are things to change 1. Share this app button, who uses that? Swap it out to either show the places you are checked in, or press it to access the favourites 2. Why do I need to activate the camera for scanning, then be able to press favourites, that should already be in the main menu, thus two \u53cd\u4eba\u7c7bdesign choices make this app more cumbersome to use than what It could have been	2
15108	What piece of s***can't even register all I get is try again later and this has been going on for 4 days now Who ever made the app needs to fix this cos I have tried my work phone number and my partners number and the same thing "please try again later"	2

15121	Every time I open it, it is not active, it's always saying to disable battery optimisation, when you 'allow battery optimisation' it turns back on. Try again the next day. It doesn't seem to keep the setting. Very big flaw as you don't even know that the app has de-activated itself.	1

15173	Phone roasting and battery draining suoer quick... where is the fix for this. Installed the app the day it was released. Saturday 8th August received a message to say that an app was draining my battery... did I wish to put to sleep. It was the Covid tracker app. I selected yes. I have since deleted the app and attempted to clear the cache (of which there seems to be a lot?) Phone still very hot and eating the battery.	1

15222	Great and helpfull app	0
15223	very good	0
15224	Downloaded due to hearing of recent cases in my area in qld, was expecting the app to alert me to these cases and provide information about the pop up clinic nearby and the list of places those people have been where I could be at risk but the app provides no such information, even when I click on the news and updates link it shows very little information on the matter. Seems like a pretty important feature to have on an app with the ability to know my location and alert me to the risk.	2

15230	I dont know when i was using this unfortunally it closed ..i tried my times to install it again..but it is showing the same thing.. Please recover this problem	2
15231	Whoever made this app has no common sense whatsoever. Firstly, as a national serviceman I do not have my NRIC and thus no way to see what my NRIC date of issue is. I had to go beg an incompetent S1 branch for it. Secondly, it takes such a long time to open the app. Huge inconvenience to users. Thirdly, the above mentioned points only apply if one is even able to set up the app(watching grass grow is faster and frankly less infuriating). Thanks for nothing.	2

15271	Make the app to be able to run with location services turned off, since it only uses bluetooth. Why does one's movements need to be tracked using location services? You can still use mobile tower connections and other users' bluetooth connections to trace movements and proximity to others. Just reduce the time it takes to confirm proximity to other users from 15 minutes to a shorter time period. I'm not going to be turning on location services for this App or any other App.	1

15274	The tracetogether QR code scanner does not work on the Mi 10 lite phone.	2
15275	Not working \u2639\ufe0f	1
15276	Downloaded app. In two minutes the OTP expires and does not allow end user to reinstall app. 2nd time no OTP number given for verification. Same with mother's and sister's phone. 1st time entering pin no. it says incorrect. Which is odd given we had quickly written the 6 digit numbers needed. While app is to assist in tracing, to upload is user unfriendly	2
15277	My main concern is Is the battery life. The phone doesn't survive the whole day when Bluetooth is always on. Other issue is I believe it is interfering with other Bluetooth connected devices such as my fitness watch. I always having issues connecting to it after installing this app. Most of the time i have to restart the phone.. :/ QR code scanning also had some issues. However i received an update to the app. Need to monitor and see.	1
15278	The intention is good but this app is so rushed it brings more problem to the user ranging from overheat, PRIVACY, risk of getting hacked, etc. Just read through the reviews. If its possible to put 0 or 0.5 star people will do it. I hope this gets fixed asap!!!	1
15279	I cant even go beyond the place where u have to give ur personal details it just stops loading halfway i tried uninstalling and reinstalling again it didnt work	2

15286	The app is great but could you explain how the app tracks users through bluetooth technology and as a suggestion could you use other forms or ways to track users as bluetooth uses an unusual amount of battery life over a long period of time.	0
15287	My phone broke after installing this app. The apps wont update from google play, and the bluetooth connection with my watch and car became erratic.	1
15288	Battery die	1
15289	Haven't had the app open for a few months, because I thought I would get notified if exposed. Opened it today and got a notification that I have been exposed. I know it couldn't have been from today, so that exposure could have been weeks or months old and I wouldn't know it. The app need to push notifications when not open to actually work! I'm gonna get tested, but in reality I could have exposed so many people without knowing it!	2
15290	Good	0
15291	I support the project. But in my case it consumes a lot of battery and my phone do not reach the evening any more. That is also the moment of the day where I potentially meet more peoples. So it makes the application unuseful to me. Maybe an idea would be to have the possibility to define some criteria where the application stop itself. For example by checking for available wireless? I think the application don't need to run at home or at work (if it is not related with public). That would maybe save a lot of battery.	1

15301	No support for lower android versions	2
15302	The app wud serve purpose if it had provisions to include people whose QID has expired. As the same people are unable to leave country due to travel restrictions. Imagine if any of such people are infected with covid, cannot be tracked...	2
15303	Beware, the terms and conditions of this app state that data from it can be used to prosecute you. Australians are now being arrested for protesting,, Australia is not a democracy, recommend you don't allow this totalitarian government to monitor you.	1
15304	My phone battery is draining really fast since installing this. Have to recharge at least twice during the day with normal use. Plus my phone is running hot all the time.	1
15305	It is good for me and for all indian	0
15306	This app is focussed and good in intent and execution. One change which would in my opinion add to the appeal and efficacy of the app would be enhanced if statistics for past seven days was added. The "from start to date" graph is unhelpful to the extent that it does not reflect recoveries and discharges from hospital.	2

15400	This app is not open	1
15401	I don't understand how such an app is made mandatory. It should be tested before being a recommendation. It drains my battery so much. I've even tested it on both android and iphone and both battery utilization is bad. The app causes lots of frustration. I rather scan my IC then use this app.	1
15402	Can I suggest you setup a colour system, that resets after 2 weeks. Red - When the user has been found infected Orange - When they are awaiting test results. Yellow - When they have exited a Hot Zone (use geo fences to determine if they have entered for more than an hour or so) Green - When all is OK Shops and Border crossings etc could ask them to show the app for extra confirmation	2
15403	I hope it works. I only got a notification that my test results were negative in the app, but those results cannot be found anymore. People keep aski g for your test result, but they are not to be found in the app anymore..Did not receive sms.	2

15406	This app is functioning useless, as it relies on users restarting it every so often. Current community usage would be minimal at best. It should be abandoned in it's current form and the government should support citizens using the covid tracing functionality built into Android and IOS. Stop blundering along with this.	1
15407	I've downloaded, sooner we all download this sooner we get to the otherside. You can delete at any time. You might just save a life, even your own or your kids! Conspiracy theorists paranoia peeps and paranormals, aliens, UFO fans etc etc of course need not apply! It's your choice!	1

15420	I agree with others here that the app chews through the battery at an alarming rate. In a given day, it consumed 9% of the battery (compared to screen at 5 %). Very discouraging.	1
15421	It's Good	0
15422	Nice and straight forward to use.	0
15423	Bruh my battery life said "Help me! Im dying x.x"	1

15441	This app is useless,I will not stand for the human indecency of you looking in to my private life.you have no right to request this of any residents and make them do the impossible of paying 200000 QR or facing jail time,this is not an applicable time to do this to the unemployed and the people who have lost their jobs...this is against all human rights of all people, colour,gender and creed. It will not work on my phone when I deny all permissions, please update accordingly so I can deny all	1

15444	This app is really helpful. It gives us the capability to easily get a comprehensive and precise report regarding covid19 around the globe. The scanning feature is also useful during this time of a pandemic.	0
15445	25000 cases in Sindh and 5 pins on all of Karachi for radius alert. An app like this is only as good as the data running on it.	2
15446	I was using this app since May'20 it suddenly stopped working and not when I reinstalled and tried many times to login however, its throwing error as " couldn't login you" and I don't know what to do now	1
15447	I didn't understand why the app needs access to the files AND memory of the phone. I understand location and call but the others?!? Can anybody explain this please?	2
15448	donot apen	1
15449	The app is very good and I never had any problem with it. But since I installed it about 2 months ago it didn't give any warning about people having the Covid19 around me, in which I guess not much people using it.	0
15450	Good	0
15451	I tried 4 times to register. Each time the facial recognition did not work. It's too difficult. Wasted my time.	2
15452	Don't know why need to download this at all. Singpass app has the same application and much more stable.	1
15453	Easy to download & get going. But needs to be simple and straight forward to serve tracking purpose.	0
15454	Now thinks it's 30th April instead of 30th September after updating app	1
15455	Apple released a core OS function for COVID-19 exposure notifications which will allow apps like this to function better. Why even in the latest version is it not being leveraged?	1
15456	Good app to help people's during this pandemic, my suggestion is there's a lot people's those don't understand English language, so wasn't this better if you give options to select language, so everyone can understand and take advantage of this application, As our national, official language is Urdu. Not complaining just a suggestion	0

15464	My battery has been draining constantly. Yesterday, the 9th, I deleted the app. Reinstalled it last night. Went to bed, with 90% battery to wake to it being down to 15%.

15471	i dont like it becose it requires location and bluetooth on, witch takes battery, but more importantly: makes google track me, and thats no good... i give it 1 becose its only effective if infected people install it and use it witch noone will.its more effective to wear a mask that says "i have covid", no tracking with satelites, no battery wasted!	2

15473	I tried to key in my profile and the system kept prompting that my NrIc no., Was invalid! So, not able to complete the registration process. I have even tried to uninstall the apps and re-installed, still facing the same problem.	2
15474	Uninstalled, which is unfortunate as I'm a health worker and believe in these kinds of things. My phone (S10) battery was draining much quicker, plus my phone kept overheating. Since I deleted the app, my phone hasn't overheated at all.	1
15475	I can't even register my phone because too many users. Please help.	2
15476	Installed app, other Bluetooth wouldn't work especially car connection . Uninstalled app other Bluetooth worked then installed app again and other Bluetooth again not working.

15500	Why does it keep asking me to upgrade after I have upgraded.	2
15501	I support the idea of this app, but like so many others experience, this app just keeps turning off on my android phone even though my settings are all correct. I have tried to reinstall it several times but it still turns off. I have nothing else using Bluetooth. Now we have cases in our community with high risk citizens and there is still no response to any emails nor any update released after months of feedback sent. This is lives we are talking about. PLEASE FIX THIS APP!	0
15502	Help... I can't seems to get the OTP to send to my Number even I have checked the number and tap on resend code multiple times...	2
15503	Is it possible my app has been hacked? I force stopped it because the headphones symbol kept appearing as though someone was listening (no headphones plugged in). Same thing happened on my partner's phone (both android). We were also getting lots of ads for things that it was not possible for someone who was not with us to know about (no discussion in messages or emails, just in person etc). We traced it back to the covid safe app on both phones. Both of us have since stopped the app from working and noticed the headphone symbol has stopped appearing - need more time to confirm impact on advertisements.	1
15504	Very bad information, every kelurahan all red or all green.	1
15505	Won't accept my phone number, says it is not a valid number	2
15506	Despite being Force Closed at the time, this filthy piece of trash auto-launched itself as part of an update. Completely illegal behaviour by an app. On top of that, this steaming turdburger has no way in app to close it, or control it. Ausfailian Made at it's worst.	2
15507	I scan some QR codes in some places and it can't work.	2
15508	Good appl	0
15509	It's supposed to be an app running in the background. When turning it on the notification comes up and reads "restart the phone if this notification disappears". Guess what? I should restart my phone every 5-10 minutes. Looking forward to the next release	2

15526	Useless app. Both me and my flatmate downloaded the app. As soon as one got the Corona confirmed, put the number, the tracing ended! Crazy coze we both got Corona second time from a Corona positive person, but the app didn't warn us about meeting someone positive because it no longer worked.. It gives you FALSE security and actualy ENCOURAGES transmission of Coronavirus. Also my friend took 24 hours to receive a notification of someone being positive even though we are flatmates lol Pointless	2
15527	Forced close, uninstall reinstall, OTP malah tak terkirim. Sekarang malah terblokir...	2
15528	Five attempts and still has not downloaded to my phone. No problem with my wife's phone. She's up and running, but I keep being told it's installed on mine, yet somehow it remains invisible to me and my searches.

Network error (such as timeout, interrupted connection or unreachable host) has occurred. there is not even a contact details which I could reach out to contact with such incidents..	2
15534	How to get more downloads on your app? 1) say its optional but highly recommended 2) force your conscripts into downloading it 3) ??? 4) PROFIT! What you gonna do? CHARGE ME LORH! But srsly, yes the pandemic is a serious problem. You guys can say you have state of the art security measures in place to prevent security breaches. But what you gonna do when it does get out? The most you can say is 'too bad we'll do better'. Is it a problem if ppl don't want to download it due to privacy concerns?	2
15535	Easy to setup and use. Does exactly what is needed while protecting privacy. Good work	0

15545	Works very well, took a second to install, didn't ask for any info, just gets on with it. Note that you only get anything out of it if it detects that you were close to someone who had the virus for at least 15 minutes. As hardly anyone has it in Japan, you likely won't get many hits, maybe none, at the moment at least (Essentially because preemptive efforts like this are working).	0
15546	Yyyy so slow	2

15598	If this is designed to work north and south of the border (which it appears to be) then it really needs to have the northern 6 counties included in the county breakdown. The UK government attempt at an app fell on its face (as much of what they do seems to) which means us northerners need to be included in the island wide effort to try to keep our numbers down and nowhere near the ridiculous levels across the water as they pursue a policy of herd immunity no matter what they say they are doing.	0

15617	Good	0
15618	I saw an dialog saying this app will log locations for debugging purpose after an update. But the installed app says they do not log location and access to location is required for bluetooth only. However the app keeps showing warning until you turn on GPS. It does not make sense.	2

15664	Good	0
15665	The latest update is smashing my battery. Until recently the app barely registered in terms of battery consumption but the latest update has it at the top for battery consumption. Given that the efficacy of the app is near to pointless, I'm tempted to remove this app and rely on Google maps tracking instead.	1

15677	The app is great and works fine, but for samsung user's it seems to have some issues such as the bluetooth connectivity is always turned on, notification sounds occurs every 2-3 min, some cases the screen is on until the app is forcefully stopped or till the screen lock button is pressed( screen timeout doesn't work). Hope so in the coming update all these bugs will be fixed.	2
15678	Please bring back the feature to search for locations and check in like how it's done on the SingPass app. This will speed up entry instead of making everyone cluster together to scan the QR code.	2

15692	Needs to be available in foreign app stores. I have this app installed and I have no complaints. I don't know whether it works but it has been unobtrusive. However I note that this was (and maybe still is) available only in the Swiss app store. Some apps, most notably WhatsApp, bind identities to telephone numbers and as a result people who move to Switzerland or who spend a lot of time here but live abroad often do not change their telephone number and are still tied to e.g. the French Google app store. Native Swiss are unlikely to have this problem, so this does not explain the limited uptake of the app, but it does contribute to the limited uptake. I would also argue that international jet-setters are relatively high risk and so are people for whom the app is most likely to yield useful effects. If the app is still restricted to the Swiss google app store, please free it.	0
15693	It would be helpful if its include features for instance, register two or three addresses, issue permits for family members, one hour permit isn't enough... Etc	1

15700	The app is not working.. When iam sign uping entering the details it's showing something went wrong.. Please try after some time.... Please solve the issue	2
15701	Location cannot be turned off. Privacy-first? This is tracking garbage at its finest. Simple solution: Uninstall. You need to have location services on at any times using this "anonymous" Tracing App. Meaning you will be tracked by 3rd party anyway. There is no way turning it off which is absolutely critical for a "privacy-by-design" application. Useless ??	1
15702	The interface is quite easy to use and i like the nested checkin between establishments. But maybe about 20% it hang when trying to launch and scan while in a mall (both nested and single checkin). It also hang when i use my phone playing games, screen showing option to wait or close app. Hopefully the bugs can be fixed since i foresee we need to checkin up to end of the year or beyond. Im using samsung galaxy A9 (2018 phone).	2
15703	Great app. Works well. It does use a little bit more battery but that was to be expected especially with older phones. To the people complaining about GPS, this app is completely open source, you can take a look and assure yourself that GPS is nowhere used. The location permission is a shortcoming of the android API. If you don't trust the app from the playstore, compile and install it yourself. Or root your phone and then disable GPS completely.	0
15704	While entering pin code in the sign up page, it doesnt do anything. Sad	2
15705	After update it's not working. When I open app it closed automatically.	2

15715	This is not encouraging so the developer of this apps should make it available for iPhone 5 users. Some people may not have the money to buy the latest phone because of this. As is a government directives to download this apps, let there be a way to help those that can\u2019t buy bigger phones.	0
15716	Simple to use. Worth downloading and using.	0
15717	Seems to be using excessive amount of battery. Update 28/08/20 Since the software fix my phone battery usage has returned to normal. Also with the last app update it is much better more information and you can now be informed re Covid 19 status in the country and your county. Much improved. Well done ??. Keep it up.	1

15733	Very happy to download this app. If needed by medical personnel, the information gathered will help to assist with contacting people that may have come into contact with a coronavirus carrier, and that can only be a good thing. The naysayers and scaremongers need to grow up and download this app to help out their fellow Australians during this pandemic.	0
15734	Used up the battery from first use. After a week of charging the phone frequently it stopped working. Had no issues until downloading the app. Would not use it. It was not a new phone but worked. Drains battery on older phones.	1

15773	It was painful at first, tried to enter phone number and it kept saying it was invalid - eventually fixed itself. Got it going and its using more battery than usual but not outrageous. It does cut out the bluetooth on my cars speakers as I drive past others - I guess they have it? It's a little clunky but seems to be ok. Concerned about the location tracking on it - need to investigate.	1

15821	I have been trying to put in all my details properly yet it says validation fail. I don't understand why it shows that my name and my IC no is wrong. I did it many time and yet cannot go through as all my details are correct. Another thing is even when I put my OTP correctly it says it is wrong.This app has some issues they need to rectify soon. Really annoying. I am uninstalling it.	2
15822	Contract tracing doesn't work on my phone despite the fact I have a Huawei P20 that is operating on Android 9. No idea why the tracing isn't working.	2
15823	This app is broken. It only shows quarantine center locations in radius alert. It gives you a false sense of safety that you are in a safe zone. However I can personally attest that there were 4 cases in my back street which the app didn't show. The data is not updated in realtime.	1
15824	The app is draining battery too much	2
15825	Had app on phone for past 3-4 weeks no issues to note. Until the last few days noticed serious drain on phone battery it got to the point I was receiving warning that the CPU was over heating and the phone shut down. Unfortunately I have had to uninstall this app.	1
15826	All good. No issues on my OnePlus 6T	0
15827	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

15829	10pc battery drain on a Google Pixel 2xl per hour, while at home.. Having this app on my phone over the next 12-18m required for a vaccine to be discovered also means charging this phone 2-4x instead of the usual 1-2x per day. This will severely impact the expected life of my phone and also, my usage of it. Please fix these battery issues asap!	1

15842	Couldn’t log in so reset password using Forgot Password option. Entered code and successfully created new password. App didn’t let me log in with new password so app becomes useless.\nUpdate: Received advice from developers to delete app and reinstall and this fixed the issue.	2
15843	Stupid only allow this to scan in! I take my token for F now?	2
15844	Used it for a month. Uninstalled it because it drained battery too quick. Shame because I would have liked to continue to use it...	1
15845	Currently, this only works for those of us with a telco subscription. Would be useful for those transient or work permit workers who don't subscribe to the aforementioned service but are dependent on wifi for their wechat, line or whatsapp communication using their mobile devices. Pls offer this in Chinese too.	2
15846	Otp does not work all the time	2
15847	I Can't install the app even when all Terms & Conditions accepted. Hope the developers address the issue ASAP for ease in installation. Thanks	2
15848	Access to phne call, media, camera and phne files NO WAY. Turning blutooth & location is fine. But it drains my battery so fast and makes my phne hot. Any suggestions before i register again???	1
15849	Good idea...but it’s destined to be ineffective. To get an alert, an infected person needs to not only register, but has to be wandering around close by while infected when he/she should be in quarantine. If the infected person is within range for me to get an alert it’s going to be after they are healthy again (more than likely). So how is this app supposed to help?	1

15860	The only complaint that I have with the app is the amount of battery it drains from my phone. I have my device on battery saver and it seems to override it. Other than that the app is so critical to hopefully easing some restrictions.	1
15861	This app seriously sucks battery life. As it is constantly exchanging data with other phones via bluetooth. It has put me off using the app.	2
15862	Worth doing to get the country back on its feet. Location data is not shared, your privacy is kept intact (people have already explored the code to find out). Get this app and save some lives!	0

15898	The app is eating my batteries life. There been no notification on the app to say there was a problem. The information given on the App is pretty useless.

Truth is I never ever sign up for anything in UAE with my home country number. Kindly fix urgently as my work requires I get tested every two weeks. Thanks.	2
15922	The checkin process has been greatly sped up. A few pointers though, after the Nov. patch (5th of the month i think) the UI felt like a downgrade from the previous one. 1) Having the menu display everything is better than the current sideway sliding menu. 2) I see no reason to display the patient name; with the counter, it's taking half the screen. But all in all, not bad ??	0
15923	There're huge vulnerable segments that this app doesn't reach. These are foreign workers and senior citizens. Most of these users are still on Android Kitkat. Probably 9/10 users in this demographic segment are on Kitkat. This OS is still popular in cheap phones sold to this demographic segment. Phones on Kitkat are still available for retail. I hope you can kindly build support for Kitkat.	2

It would also be nice to link all paper permits to the app. Some of the depents, do not life with the household and the app should take that into consideration.	0

15938	I installed app on IPhone 7. Bluetooth drains my phones battery so I don't always keep it on. When I turn on app,it says app is active even though my Bluetooth is off. \nApps check phone status all the time to work properly. This COVID app doesn't. At least not in my phone.\n\nSo, if I forget to turn on Bluetooth before I leave the house, the App is useless.	1

15969	Good	0
15970	This uses the privacy preserving contact tracing methods developed jointly by Apple and Google. Your past contacts are anonymously stored on the phone and you are alerted if a contact (who runs the app as well) is tested positive. The effectiveness would increase of more people used this. So keep using it folks! This is not created solely to inform people about latest numbers, nor "hotspot locations", so negative comments are a bit missing the mark.	2
15971	Yeah it's a good app	0
15972	With the COVIDSafe app installed I'm unable to install updates to any apps through the play store. Some notifications are repeating and others delayed or not received.

15976	Everytime i installed trace together app, my phone becomes very slow and laggy. Even after turning off bluetooth at home, my phone is still very laggy	2
15977	Maybe the app should send a message to the ppl who's phone it's installed on to, and ask them 'how they feel', instead of relying on ppl to go on the app and tell it 'how they feel' I have forgotten to go on it sometimes...	1

Bluetooth signal should only be a few meters afaik. So i doubt this app is working as intended. Edit reply: 700+ (and increasing) devices means likely the whole block of flats or maybe even few blocks away. How is this effective? To me it's likely inaccurate if too many people are registered around me of which im not even in contact with	1

16081	I like the app as it is as private as it can be. Suggestions for improvements: I would like current figures rather than totals. Daily new cases and daily number of current active cases would be useful. Same for the county breakdown list. Total numbers are useless. The daily confirmed cases graph is not accurately readable. A covid check in reminder would be useful too. Another feature, that lets you enter the country of current stay would be useful as that can make sure that the app and covid warnings will work in the whole of Europe - provided that European apps work in the same way. E.g. the change of countries could be detected by the app and the user could be asked whether (s)he wants to change the country. The app can only be found by searching for "covidtracker", it can NOT be found by searching for "covid tracker". Google could have picked a better word for location - some reviewers think that it tracks the location. No, location service is needed for the bluetooth scanning only. No GPS used. Also for google: I tried to use paragraphs in the review to make my review readable. Why are they taken out?	0

16176	The application doesn't support iPhone 6 mobiles ,you should have IOS 13.1 at least so u can download it . I purchased new mobile to download the App \ud83d\ude00 . After downloading it 's not giving the OTP password . I called the supporting team call center# 109 to help but the agents are always busy . They said " u can expect call within 2 hours " now it's been 6 hours and no one called . This application needs technical improvement to work in all type of mobiles and to give the OtP immediately. Thanks	2
16177	Not sure if my 1st review went through... the app does not recognise my NRIC and i cannot use it. This happened when i reinstall the apps	2
16178	Can developers please add 14 day incidence rate per 100 per county and national please. It would be good to look at numbers this way if this is the kpi that the government lockdown framework is based upon	1
16179	Great initiative. Problem. My office locate along a corridor..people walking past our office all the time..I have high number of contacts because Bluetooth signal resulting inaccuracy.	2

16183	Nice to be updated on this matter	0
16184	1. Ok, it\u2019s installed, but how do I know it\u2019s working properly? 2. Why can\u2019t the Government find a data store of its own that is secured either owned by an Australian based company or at a secure Government location? 3. Why hasn\u2019t the source code been published so that it can be peer reviewed. 4. Why is there a need to enter Registration details when this information should only be entered when required? 5. Why has this been fast tracked when Apple and Google will provide a framework which would be interoperable internationally and will be implemented in such a way that data is decentralised and a external data store is not required. 6. This app will have severe limitations as it needs to be running in foreground, the Apple and Google framework does not require this. 7. Is there\u2019s any evidence that this will provide an effective solution to contact tracing?	1

16191	While the app is a great start, there should be a way to turn the beacon off or maybe have an hourly/manually update option like the weather widget. While I understand why it is important to have the beacon live but it defeats the purpose if the battery wont last \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f	0

16196	Drains battery	1
16197	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0

16217	Broken notification - Currently showing notification "COVIDSafe is not active" but tapping notification opens app and it says "COVIDSafe is active. No further action is required". Hopefully it really is working. Might be useful, but can't be sure. I've installed this app and so far haven't got Covid 19 (that I know of). Registration was easy, and can be done using a pseudonym. Battery usage is quite low.	2
16218	Battery draining... Because of that, I had to unistall it!	1

16241	Excellent App. Any chance ye could up date it every day to let us know when there is a briefing?	0
16242	From 19/12/20 CPU usage of this app has skyrocketed to over 20% of my mobile phone battery daily usage. My Phone is a Samsung S9 with Android 10 latest patch. I now have to recharge my smartphone twice a day. See below usage values for the CovidSafe App. on 21/12/20 11.1%, on 20/12/20 20.3%, on 19/12/20 5.8%, on 18/12/20 1.1%, on 17/12/20 1.2%, on 16/12/20 1.4%, on 15/12/20 1.2%. The app appears to have a virus worm that flattens battery in devices. I've had the app for more than 6 months and this has never happened in the past. I'm trying to contact technical support but my hold time is 40 minutes. I'm stating just the facts and expressing no angry emotions I'm feeling right now!	1

16262	Wonderful	0
16263	Good so far, I just downloaded and it gives you very clear notices that the device does not use GPS but requires location services to be enabled because of BLE. It means that other apps that can use GPS to track you are working also but the app itself does not seem to be a problem	0
16264	Removed it it was to much for me I can't cope with it	1
16265	Very good app	0
16266	HAS DESTROYED MY PHONE BATTERY LIFE. I have one of the best phones for battery life and this app has absolutely destroyed it. My phone battery has went down by 13% in 18 minutes. My battery would usually last me the entire day, now it's due to last for 3 hours. This is disgusting. I'm beyond angry. €1000 phone ruined by 1 app. Are the HSE going to reimburse those that have used this app for the common good, but have been punished by the app destroying their phones??	1
16267	Every other week it just becomes inactive and has to be reloaded and all contact tracing is lost.	1

16275	REMOVE THE NOTIFICATION FOR ANDROID, ITS EXTREMELY DISTRACTING.	2
16276	The app got stuck. Google pixel 3. Not able to register. Previous version works.	2
16277	Download is difficult for very odd seniors. You should keep it = Simple =- KISS it.	0
16278	Not sure how those iPhones work, but with Android you now have to allow the app to know your location, so obviously Big Brother had sneakily changed it to track your location.	2
16279	1. There was like 1-2 seconds delayed during checking in/out comparing to SingPass SafeEntry check in(it is almost instant).\n\n2. Should have one group check in button to press instead of every time I have to press check in then press back again only can choose group check in. (Widget)\n\n3. Should have option to search for location as well. If you would like to says not to has location search is to ensure everyone appear on where they are then you should not have the  favourite.\n\nPlease refer to SingPass safe entry to adopt their functionality, they did a great app and widget.	1

16300	I believe this is a good way to track people....but its alot of battery load on my phone. You can make it appear more user "friendly", as it is just tracking people all the time even when there home. People can feel safe if You guys can add an option called going out, where the bluetooth and tracking starts and not all the time and switch it off at home.	1
16301	When will the problem with battery draining be solved ? While I realise the app is important to have , I will have to delete if not resolved pretty soon as my phone is not safe as it is draining from 100% to 35 % in 2.5 hours and it is very hot.	1
16302	Disappointing it doesn't tell me I need to update	2
16303	Glitchy	2
16304	I have an issue with the app, I have a Samsing Galaxy 10 phone and a Samsung Galaxy watch, once I had installed this app it crashed my watch and all notifications stopped on both my phone and watch. I have tried several time installing and uninstalling both this app and my Samsung wearables app and now I have had to completely remove the COVIDSafe app.	1
16305	Draining my battery. Lots of chat about this online but no notifications from HSE. Staying quiet and hoping it goes away or that ordinary people will figure it out for themselves is not a strategy that inspires trust. Is this what happened with the Nursing Homes?	1

16339	I thought this app would use a lot of battery due to Bluetooth, but it uses only 1% per hour, which is very reasonable. I also was concerned that the app would track my location, but it works on Android even with location settings turned off, which is my default (I never have location on). For the very minimal amount of data it collects, I am more than happy having this app on my phone and running constantly. Will make contact tracing significantly expedited and accurate. A lifesaver of an app.	1

16347	When i received the OTP to register my phone number, the OTP number was trancated. I have to go to my sms to view the OTP number. However, when I return to the TraceTogether app it led me to the beginning for me to set my phone number again. Very frustrating and i can't register at all. Why this smaller common problem is being overlooked? Very disappointed.	2

16357	When I downloaded this app over the 3 days I noticed my Wi-Fi speed on the phone was 50% less then normal. At the same time all my tablet with Bluetooth device was affected. Including my work laptop. When i uninstalled it my Wi-Fi and all device internet speed was back to normal as in not 50% less. Does this mean this app has some affect on neighbouring home tablets phone laptops with Bluetooth affecting the Wi-Fi speeds?	2

16359	Crash issue fixed.now its working fine.	2
16360	I have two complaints: 1. This app drains the battery way too much, it's always the top one that affects my battery even though I don't run it. 2.

16379	Works very well, took a second to install, didn't ask for any info, just gets on with it. Note that you only get anything out of it if it detects that you were close to someone who had the virus for at least 15 minutes. As hardly anyone has it in Japan, you likely won't get many hits, maybe none, at the moment at least (Essentially because preemptive efforts like this are working).	0

This doesnt seem to be how this virus works (Seeing as everyone in the thai restaurant got it!). I know, or have details of everyone I'm closer than 1.5m to.

16437	Can the app not constantly show a notification when nothing is happening? I am very tempted to turn off notifications if the notifications is on all the time.	2

16452	Oh look they deleted my comment... Security Analysis here. Please take a moment to look at the Assistance and access ACT 2018. Anyone infected is instantly tied to their phone number. From there, their name, ph, and address are all flagged. This is a huge privacy issue. This app should ONLY work through bluetooth, and can be modified to operate without a phone number.	1
16453	After update, I kept keying my nirc but apps keeps mentioning error and cannot register. How come it's like that. Please help.	2
16454	Woke up to my phone batter nearly completely drained and overheating. I have had to delete it which is not ideal due to the current climate but the app wouldn't work if my phone is dead when I'm out anyway	1

16457	Worst app even... so many people got msg but when checking in this app it didnt show..you need to update also not any options also atleast their should be some tab for share difficulty to operate app. No operater also and support techinican is also not there.	1
16458	Y ?	2
16459	it drains my battery like hell since it always runs in the background, requires bluetooth to be switched on 24/7, and most important DOESNT EVEN WORK unless everyone else is as stupid as you to use this faulty app. GovTech please stop promoting trash to us	1

16467	Massive Battery Drain and Overheating. Irish media saying fix has been rolled out yet this app hasn't been updated since July 15th. Google play services also not updated in a long time. Has this been fixed yes or no????	1

But now after registering or re-logging in to my account, it keeps showing up error after I click on my account (EIDA number). Call center agents are clueless and even on choosing English as an option I'm diverted to Arabic speaking agents. Hope the developers can take this review seriously for an app as critical to the nation's well being.	1
16481	Good until it made my phone overheat. Uninstalling the app did not get it off my phone at that point, so I had to factory reset my phone to get it to stop overheating.	1

16563	Good	0
16564	Excellent	0
16565	Not working. It says it has no internet connection which obviously is wrong as I am connected over wifi and 4G and downloaded the app several times. There are kids on the internet that can build a better app and in french.	1

16568	App will not send the pin to my mobile number, cannot reactivate the app on my iPhone that up until now, has not had any problems. Trying to do the right thing however when the app server appears to be faulting it is getting more and more difficult to maintain the app use that is constantly draining my phone battery. Please URGENTLY resolve the app issue!! Note - not a user error, I have wifi off, have not had issues up until today with using the app.	2
16569	Why does the app want me to turn on bluetooth all the time?!?! Also, the notification banner will not go! Garbage app that's just a waste of ur phone battery \ud83d\ude24	1
16570	We need to know who is your authority?	1
16571	This seems to be draining more battery than it should. Which means more people wouldn't want to use it when they are out. Optimize this app to use the least amout of battery as possible.	0
16572	So easy to install, people that have had problems must be complete dipsticks.	0
16573	Activation impossible. Nul.	1
16574	I too had the app constantly switch off. SOLUTION: i believe the following two things can help this solution (seems to have helped me through the last day): 1. Settings - Location -... - Scanning - disable Bluetooth Scanning. I believe this interrupts the covidsafe app. 2. Settings - Developer Options (google this to find out how to enable) - enable Bluetooth HCI Snoop Log. Having reported issue and possible solution through the app, why I haven't heard back from Covidsafe app team.	1
16575	Help nothing at all. Two of my colleagues had been tested positive on COVID 19 in 3 months, nothing happened on this alert. Shame.	1
16576	Awesome/ user friendly, convenient and case Sensitive to tap safe entry. Can saved safe entry QR for frequent visit places.	0

16580	Lucky enough as was selected to use the app by Saudi Govt during testing phase.. Excellent app and very easy and simple to use. Thumbs up for the developers who made it so easy to request permit during Curfew.	0
16581	I noticed that since I've been using the App, my music on my wireless headphones has got intermittent lags. Especially when I'm in the gym or shopping centre. I can confirm this but I think it's whenever the app logs a contact, the music lags. If I played it through the physical earphones there's no problem. So I'm guessing the Bluetooth connection has got something to do with it.	2
16582	Best app for precautions and safety	0
16583	Good	0
16584	Honestly everything is running in the background but hopping on and seeing that thumbs up is kinda reassuring.\n\nAlso it’s not a news app or anything having notifications on doesn’t spam you with anything which I gotta admit I was worried about.\n\nHowever I worry that the app can’t work while it’s not in the running apps list, I tend to keep that clear at all times so I’m desperately trying to leave it open.	0
16585	Good but some smart phone has not supported the application	1
16586	Not good	0
16587	Gold	0
16588	The app did not help me at all. I tried to locate the covid people who are near me, no results was given, not a good app. No tips on prevention of covid, no news that help, need data or wifi to connect. Not easy to use. Sorry but good effort on your part. Deleted it.	1
16589	I waited for the test results that have never been available in the app even if the test had been successfully added: "Your result is not yet available".	2
16590	I cannot download with name, ic and dob keep showing red cannot move to next step	2
16591	after changing phone number cannot receive otp and i try many times delete apps reinstall also fail	2
16592	Very helpful	0
16593	Seems to work just fine, but the interface is slow and it's hard to know if this is actually running or if I have to load up the app manually every time.	2
16594	Version 2.3.10 solved zero BT tracking and tracing problems.	2
16595	I think it's a great idea and the app works perfectly fine......I highly recommend that everyone downloads it because at the end of the day wouldn't you like to know if you have come in close contact with someone that has the Coronavirus.	0

16602	Awesome app. Keeps me informed	0
16603	The app is simple, doesn’t get in my way, shows useful information about how to use it and importantly, doesn’t show any noticeable difference to battery usage.\n\nFor all those writing on Facebook, Twitter, etc about privacy concerns, you have much better privacy with this app than the social media platforms you’re writing your concerns on. Plus you have the ability to help limit the spread of COVID-19.	0
16604	Requires location to be on while using it. This is unacceptable.	1
16605	I like the app and what it's intended for and have used it diligently since installing it. On 8th Aug both my phone and my wifes phone started getting getting hot, losing battery life faster. It's like something got dialled up in the app. I reluctantly disabled it for that reason.	1
16606	Why can't you do group check in at some venues, i took my son to inchiban at waterway and they don't allow group check in, since you can only use this app and he wasn't carrying his ic since he's only 8 yrs old we couldn't check the 2 of us in, what if your child doesn't even have an ic then turned away	2
16607	The app does not recognize my mobile number. Update. Finally managed to have it recognize my phone number.	2
16608	This app is not ready! I have been a Singaporean more than 3 decades, how can the app claims i have a invalid IC number!	2
16609	Good functional application which hopefully will help stop Covid Island wide as it works cross border. It will only be successful if enough people use it so just get it on your phone.	0

16628	*update* I have been checking the exposure check from i installed the app. At the start it was was doing lots of checks between 15-18 over the previous 14 days over the last few weeks this has dropped to one. I then checked it today and i have had no exposure checks in the last 14 days! What is the point in downloading the app if exposure checks are not being done. Im unable to find in the play store using the apps name. Ended up googling it and following a link from there.	2

16630	Battery drains fast when using this even for short period of time. Prefer singpass over this, more stable platform and loads better and doesn't drain battery too	1

16665	I dont break any laws and have regular health checks, I have nothing to either fear or hide. I object to the heavily federally weighted installation of this app on historical grounds - auspol's long history with confidentiality breaches. I have this and the info app installed, along with what feels to be a complimentary ankle bracelet, despite which this may one day save a life. If I had a family who gave a damn about me I'd be more trusting of my government- you've never protected me before.	1

16668	This app though fine, does not work completely as intended. The photo upload feature has been the most erratic at its best.

Kindly fix the distutbance by allowing vibrator to be disabled.	0

But I think many people still not have understood that the Bluetooth must be turn on all the time or else the app will stop working, also if people had the previous version they should uninstall it and then install the new one, I did simply the update first but the app was not able to work properly, that's why I uninstalled it and reinstall it and Voilà it was working	0

16692	Our first personal details got registered as we opened our email address in the web world. We moved to social media apps each owned by different entities always under the scrutiny of security agencies of the nation in which the developer began the venture. Digital mode took precedence as of 2014 government opened the digital world to every Indian bringing the internet service to affordable pricing.

16711	Nice black theme implementation, I like it! Some of the preliminary text could be condensed and the full counterparts moved into menus though, currently it's long and tedious to read through. Once you're past that, the interface looks intuitive though. Good work!	0
16712	Would be good to add a way to self notify symptoms that would be considered as orange risk as long as not validated by a PCR test (red risk). The whole process with testing is too slow given the contagiousness starts even before symptoms.	2

16722	can't even download the stupid app. why since already using sing pass app to sign in	2
16723	1. There was like 1-2 seconds delayed during checking in/out comparing to SingPass SafeEntry check in(it is almost instant).\n\n2. Should have one group check in button to press instead of every time I have to press check in then press back again only can choose group check in. (Widget)\n\n3. Should have option to search for location as well. If you would like to says not to has location search is to ensure everyone appear on where they are then you should not have the  favourite.\n\nPlease refer to SingPass safe entry to adopt their functionality, they did a great app and widget.	1
16724	So far so good but hope I don't ever get the notification ...	0
16725	I tried to install the app on an iPhone 6S but it stalled on the Get Started > Continue step with this error message;\n\n“This operation couldn’t be completed. (ENErrorDomain error 14.)”\n\nWould like to get this app going...	2
16726	I can't open the apps when I'm done install it.	2
16727	App needs to stop lagging and crashing everytime I open it to scan safeentry Also after reading the other reviews, SO THATS WHY MY BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES KEEP HAVING ISSUE OMG	2
16728	App is saying mobile number is invalid, it's not. No trouble shooting or number/email for issues. If the govt wants citizen to participate then get the app working properly.	2
16729	App allow be installe only in BG segment of appstore. But after start app offers to change the language bg/eng. So, if somebody prefer eng then this person can’t install the app on previous step.	2

16744	This is horrible. When I key in the OTP it tells me wrong. Then I click the resend button nothing happens. I give up!!!	2
16745	App interrupt with Bluetooth of my phone to connect with other devices. Kindly do not ask for phone brand and firmware. As I have read in the comments a lot of people are having the same issue. This is likely due to the app constant scanning or connecting to other Bluetooth devices that is causing this? Thus interrupting the devices that the phone is suppose to connect. Which are the Bluetooth devices owned by the phone owner. Purpose solution: scan is enough, there is no need to connect.	2

16755	Recently updated the app, and it uses up the battery very quickly. Battery drained up so fast that I had to uninstall app. Not worth keeping app on if it uses battery that quickly.	1

16772	just downloaded. uninstalled n download again. i cant seem to recieve the OTP.	2
16773	As per title. It’s not a very smart decision to make to force us to turn on Bluetooth & leaving it on as it drains a lot of my battery especially if I have to leave the app running in the background. Even if we bring a power bank along with us, it will also get drained out. How many power banks do you expect us to bring along? 100?\n\nAs a developer, you can’t just think from your own point of view. You’ll also need to factor in things like user experience, usability, practicality & your app isn’t the only app we are using. I use my phone for work & I can’t afford for my phone to die on me just because your app drains my phone of battery. And these days, we’re trying to travel light, am I supposed to bring along 100 power banks along with me to ensure my phone battery doesn’t die on me when I’m outside? Please take into consideration that we may not be near a power source for us to plug in our phones 24/7 or be rich enough to buy 100 power banks or have enough space in our bags to carry all these power banks or even find it light enough to do so.\n\nLast but not least, if you guys want to force us into using something you guys created, at least please make it a pleasant experience & not make us hate or detest it even more. Wouldn’t it be better to make this app so fantastic & lovable that everyone WANTS to use it & not because we’re being forced to go through a torturous experience?\n\nThank you for reading through this valuable feedback & looking into the matter.	1

Why not take a little extra time to develop something that works in the background? Sure, millions might download, but if it\u2019s a requirement to keep it open and few do, it\u2019s not gonna help much.  Also, the daily notification is annoying. When I turned notifications off, the app implied it would no longer work without it. Want to help, but do I really need a notification every morning to do so?  Minus one star for each of the above, but 3 stars for: a simple on boarding process; a clean design; and for getting it out quickly. Hoping it still works in the background!	1
16961	According to the specs, there should be no reason for this app not to work on my phone - but it doesn’t. The support text online is very minimal, and does not provide sufficiently robust instructions on exactly what settings to check if the app isn’t working as it should. I’ve reset phone, deleted and re-installed app, etc... I then emailed for tech support several days ago and am now waiting for a response of some sort.	1
16962	It’s very worst app. Sometimes working	1
16963	V easy to install	0
16964	The app interferes other bluetooth devices such as bluetooth earbuds, headphones, smart watches, etc. It makes them disconnected intermittently. Please fix this problem. Thank you.	2

16968	In the name there is space from covid to NI but no space between stop and covid. Makes it hard to find. Maybe having no spaces between words would make finding easier.	1

16970	Uses too much of my battery	1
16971	Samsung note10+ user, overall pretty neat app but had to uninstall it coz it keeps interfering with my Bluetooth earphones (nural nt01) creating shuttering. Hope it gets fixed soon.	2
16972	This app is still buggy. After I got notification about my location is at a certain zone, it keeps crashing and crashing, even when the app is closed. Resetting the app by clearing the app data and reconfiguration doesn't work; after the notification, the app crashes again over and over. Also, I found that the app process is also stopped working in the background due to the crash. Three stars for nice idea, but still need improvement in the implementation. We need you and your app. Thanks, dev	2
16973	Essential app these days	0
16974	Downloaded app early and easily. Not simple to use. Should (have option to) open at camera to avoid more work to check in. Still not enough posters around.	0
16975	Working fine. An excellent tool to track the contacts of COVID19 positive and will definitely help the healthcare officials fight this virus with help of individuals in society.My concern is that Bluetooth remains permanently ON, user should be able to switch off when he is in home.	0
16976	Crash, the app keep close it's self If I may suggest, put information about how much ODP and PDP living in one location. So we can be aware. Thanks	2

16982	Good idea but consumes a lot of battery. So I decided to uninstall it.	1
16983	Why does this app require bluetooth to work when i just want to scan qr code to go buy cai png? Make me angry grrr	2
16984	The bluetooth interfere with other blue tooth devices, initially thought airpod got problems but i switch another wireless ear piece, still got the same problem. The problem went away when i uninstall thr app. Not to mention this app drains your batt significantly! I am using Samsung Note, airpod pro and Sony WF-1000XM3 while encountering such problems.	2

16987	It was hard to open an account because the landing page after requesting OTP didn't appear, which may be due to internet connection. However when testing this with someone who has cough and was therefore categorized as "Mild Condition," nothing came up on my scan even when turning on both Bluetooth and location. There was no clear explanation on the purpose of the QR code or scanner and health information was only available in the English language. 3D world view is unnecessary and uses up memory	2

17027	Very Good initiative. Just a little concern of mine: I don't know how you keep records of Covid19 patient's phone.I could be in touch with a carrier who might be tested positive weeks after. Will i be notified then? Also there should be options for carriers to report for themselves. Without a regular and sophisticated datasets, it won't be that useful regardless of how many are using it.	0

17069	No one in Japan practices social distancing, even on trains people dont wear masks. This app seems like a waste of time unless people change their habits.	1

17071	Not good application,automatically opening Bluetooth may occur mobile virus	1
17072	Drained my battery so much. The app was running highly in the background. Major problem	1
17073	Absolutely abysmal battery usage performance samsung a20 not set to optimised.

17080	continues to call my phone number invalid. yet I've never received a six digit pin as if some random individual has used my number	2
17081	I didn't enjoy the app. As no details were given about the number of new cases in every county. I posted nearly 40 times that I had no symptoms. I received a response saying Great to hear today. The first app that I thought effectively carried out tracking and testing and tracing of existing cases.	1
17082	Unfortunately had to delete this app completely as it drained my battery even when phone was charging . Phone was unable to hold a charge with this app . After removing the app i charge the phone while turnef off to get full charge back	1
17083	Easy to find, works fine, plus you dont need your bluetooth on all the time unless you go out, only fault I find is it would be good if you could make it so you can put your post code in and find out how many is in your area that would be a big plus	0
17084	Overall experience was good. But since last week its been draining my battery very heavily. My OnePlus which used to stay for almost 1.5 days, started draining out in a few hours. Uninstalled this app and now my phone is back to normal.	1
17085	This is not working on my huwaei nova 5t	2
17086	Was working fine but since a week A RED QUESTION MARK keeps on showing up even after fulfilling all it's requirements having an updated version ,giving full access to it etc. Have reinstalled it several times.. and no one answers or call backs ever... so What's The Problem? Have they made this app necessary and this ehteraz app is not up to the mark.	2
17087	I can't access the app. It keeps saying my number isn't registered...wrong credentials. Not a good app at all.	1
17088	Does what it says on the tin. Great way to be kept informed	1

17090	A Million Thank You for this app!	0
17091	I found the app overall to be very good. It runs with no issues and it is nice to see updates on figures etc. The reason I am deducting 1 Star is that twice I've had to uninstall the app as it was causing my phone to overheat.	0

17100	Rubbish app... In our city Bahawalnagar, there are 10 confirmed patients of COVID-19 and 2 streets are closed by Deputy Commissioner. But this app shows that there are no patients in this city. Don't waste your MB to install this fake app.	2
17101	It worked for a few days but then stopped working. The app say it is working fine but when I am going out the counter stays at 0. My fried who is with me sees on the app that she came in close to proximity to 10 pax.	2
17102	Informative and more reliable	0
17103	Not useful app.no clear instructions on how to us. If I didnt test yet for corona ,how result gonna appear in app?!!!!!	1
17104	Have already posted a review but there's a few aspects that need to be improved, such as a wake up notification asking how you feel, a way for the app to turn on Bluetooth and scan in the background rather than having it on constantly, daily number of cases per county (cork +7 etc) and have the ability to have down times as there's no need to have it running when your asleep, have that settable by the users of course. And more symptoms need to be added aswell, tiredness, confusion, clumsy, etc	1

On my own mobile - keeping the app on is draining my battery very fast.	1

17109	Was working great but in the last day or so it's draining my battery in a pretty major way. I didn't know what it was at first but my phone was heating up and the battery was dropping.

17141	The application is not being supported in my phone.	2
17142	Terrible app. When left on, the app interferes with my bluetooth connection to audio devices. I can't drive with my phone connected to my car as the audio just skips everytime. Same thing with bluetooth connection to me earphones when I run. At this rate, I would rather petition the government not to use this app or even issue the token since it interferes with my life more than necessary.	1
17143	very good effort from HSE. Government and HSE are trying their best to keep people safe . this app is best . thank you	0
17144	Takes a very long time to download and set up. Spent two days downloading the app and two more days trying to set up the app to no avail.

17160	Hi everyone, just to clear up the issue with battery usage - I downloaded the app yesterday and it used about 3-4% battery in a 24 hour period according to my phone's device manager. We are here to use the app for the greater good, and if you are influenced by a few % of battery which most of the day you have access to a charger, I strongly consider you have a look at your reasoning. These comments where people are whinging about draining their entire battery is false and absolutely not helpful	1

17166	This is just an app for tracking and monitoring people. I don't see why an app that's supposed to inform me of a pandemic is asking for access to my files,gallery contacts and location. It also doesn't make any sense when such an app is being forced on us by the authorities to download it. Talk of martial law. This is privacy intrusion in petty manner.	1

17171	It was mentioned that it access to only Bluetooth but actually it does access to location & Bluetooth, if you check in Settings (especially in Android). Govt is saying that we don't access to location then does it show in the Settings of your applications. Also, Bluetooth(BT) doesn't connect automatically to other compatible BT devices. It only happens if it's paired which is not happening in COVID-19 safe app, then how on planet earth they are doing profiling. It sounds very fishy.	1
17172	This is important and if you are hesitating, know that it isn't tracking your movements... Also that it is going to give you an early warning if you've been in contact with an infected person so you can isolate and get tested and keep your family and community safe.	2
17173	It is great to have	0
17174	There should be an option to add test results manually. I had to take a test, but my doctor didn't want to register my code since "this is only for in the triage centers". Quite useless to use the app if test results can't be reported.	2

Worse yet, I'd have no clue which bus route i was on or which train or carriage i would have been in, as there are multiple options from point A to B. Doing my bit, but disappointed	2

17195	3030.6.28 The app is completely useless. So far none of a confirmed case was identified by this app and none of the people in close contact with confirmed cases were informed!  This app behaves like Youtube in that it only works when it\u2019s running in foreground. Who is going to use an iPhone as a dedicated COVID-19 app device?  Technically it\u2019s a bad app. When the COVIDSAFE app is loaded, the bluetooth becomes a mess. As seen from Settings, the Bluetooth turns on and off and on and off by itself; native bluetooth devices like Apple watch and third party headphones disconnect; medical devices like Accu Chek BGL test device and Sphygmomanometer (blood pressure test device) need to be forgotten, all mentioned above have to be reset and restarted and repair again. Terrible.	1

17199	No good every time erorr	1
17200	Why demand access to all my files and photos? Creepy.	1
17201	Although it was a charge of $0.00, I don\u2019t understand why my bank account had to be pinged . Other free apps you download without the app testing your account details. Makes me suspicious and I don\u2019t want to be.	1
17202	Nice.	0
17203	Clean and simple. Explains clearly what it does and how. Can't say (yet) if it works like it should... But that's not the fault of the app necessarily. One minor nitpick: It'd be nice if the language could be selected in the settings.	0
17204	Super	0
17205	Extremely poorly developed app. The amount of permission controls required just to allow the app to run makes my device a vulnerability to hacks. There is really no reason for bluetooth to always be on when location information is allowed. It should not have the permission to modify my contents on my phone. Also why does it need to make calls on my phone. A lot of these issues and vulnerabilities needs to be addressed.	0

17222	My Bluetooth earphones consistently cuts out every few seconds once this was installed.	2
17223	Bluetooth earpiece keep on disconnecting and reconnecting. Pls fix this bug.	2
17224	The app should be installed to at least 80-90% of the population to be effective. A better publicity campaign and easier to understand privacy explanations might be helpful.	0

17239	So far so good. Havent had any issues. Was expecting to drain the battery. But even this is not noticeable. So why not help the community to get out of this pandemic..	0
17240	Drain too much battery life... My phone is getting hot...and Bluetooth kept open that allow other devices.	1
17241	App causes connection problems with bluetooth earbuds and headphones. The Bluetooth scanning of the app interferes with the Bluetooth connection.	2

17243	Kill battery kill storage kill me	1
17244	While the app has privacy covered for use with location services other apps don\u2019t. Also the battery life is now reduced. This is why I don\u2019t use location services. Now my app won\u2019t work. Not happy.	1
17245	Should check in from 8am in the morning not allow check-in at midnight as it really means you're checking in before u sleep.	1

17247	This apps kills the fast charging on Samsung A70 and puts the device into a reboot loop after coming into contact with another phone with tracking apps installed.

17250	Got a notification to say i was in contact and had to isolate. Only problem was i had been in contact the 10th. First told of it the 23rd with 1day left to isolate. Its reliant on people updating the app with their test results and if they dont do that then nobody knows	2
17251	App doesn't accept my mobile phone number.so basicallymakes the app useless..	2
17252	Installs on my LG G4 then crashes on the 2nd setup screen.	1
17253	Doesn't alert you to infected cases in your area. Drains battery pretty fast due to Bluetooth connection. Not sure how this app is supposed to work as there's not much info coming from it. Also don't think personal data will be a concern for public health measures if it means improvement for the app.	2
17254	I don't understand i enter my own NRIC number it keeps on saying "validation failed" multiple times. Its like my NRIC doesn't exist	2
17255	unable to down load,the app	2
17256	Would be handly if you could set up a daily notification to remind you to check in. I usually dismiss drop down notifications if not urgent. It also crashed mulitiple times today when trying to open it and I had to re-install.	1

17275	Hi, I'm now able to register my mobile #, several OTP codes arrived late. Last one just in time so I'm able to register.

People said : is good chance to change the phone. So I buy another phone just for download this App. Cheers. I feedback just to let people know this App can't download or can't loading just because of your phone is too old. But some people said because their is Huawei brands so can not use Google / Appstore. I don't know.. Maybe..	2

17316	Really v bad experience with this app! Have been trying to uninstalled the app then install again & again several times to fill up my particulars but it seems the app continues to have problem with my phone. When i emailed to their support, no one is knowledgeable to attend to my queries and left me in silence and unattended. There isnt any other live chat or verbal contact which can be contacted with.	2

17325	Well it helps the gahmen to track ppl down so well is for good use but the app is very boring	0
17326	I have had the app since inception but the latest version/update requires location services turned on in addition to bluetooth. I do not have location services activated as it drains the battery, encourages unsolicited notifications & advertising, and search engines make incorrect assumptions on the information I am searching for. Why the need to know my location?	1

17334	Good apps	0
17335	Disappointed that the app cannot be used ij older smartphones such as my iPhone5. Low income and racialized communities are disproportionately affected by COVID and if the app only works on newer (expensive) phones we are potentially missing a large swath of people who would benefit from the app.	2
17336	I think it will be good to include in this app with a simple guide on how to keep the app running in the background. As every smartphones these days are equipped with power saving features that will kill the app after idling for a while to save phone battery consumption. This feature can be deactivated, but not many phone users know how to do it.	2

17345	Despite entering the correct OTP the App displays a message indicating a wrong OTP was entered. And then, after requesting for a new OTP, the App proceeds indicating the setup is complete without sending a new OTP.	2
17346	Gives you a warning in case of contact with a Covid-19 positive person. I find this very useful. Be careful when deleting google system data, it also deletes eRouska data (found this out the hard way even if it makes sense).	0

17359	This is the worst app I have ever seen in my life, it is not working at all I tried it already with 2 phones but it is not working even I accepted all the required permissions. now I am not allowed to enter any hypermarket, exchange and bank.	1
17360	The idea of such an app is very good, however, the technicalities are poor. The app is draining my phone battery and doesn't work without a permission to obtain access to the gallery and calls, which I am not fine with. Moreover, after installing it, I simply cannot control bluetooth on my phone, even if I switch it off, it lights up the screen and switches the bluetooth on itself (!). Not to mention that each notification is renounced many times and whenever comes also lights up the screen.	0

17400	Really WANT to use the app, think it's a good idea but am unable to register. The app doesn't reject my mobile phone number - it tells me it's sent the PIN to my number, which is shown correctly on the screen, but the PIN doesn't arrive. Tried wifi & mobile data, with 0 at front of my number & without, done clean reinstalls, phone (Nokia 6, Android 9) software up to date - no luck. Support unhelpful.

17422	I am a firm believer in the concept behind this app. Like other users I am experiencing issues with the app closing. In addition, it interrupts my ability to connect to my car Bluetooth meaning I have no hands free use of my phone. Please fix asap.	1
17423	Why can't this app just run smoothly without everytime asking me to allow it to switch my Bluetooth on when it is already on? Instead of using Bluetooth why don't you make it use data instead?	1
17424	Bad for my new mobile but my old mobile its working well	1
17425	Uninstalled because your "close contact" criteria is useless for me. All my contscts are much shorter than 15 mins, and still, as I get out for shopping etc, I have a chance to contact with the virus. And app will not detect such a contact as something it should inform me. So, this app can give false security feeling. I don't need this. It maybe a bit useful for people who are still working with others Reduce the time, increase the distance. We have enough tests available now as far as I know	1

17429	Everyday update app not good enough.	1
17430	Pros: Nice UI Cons: Drains battery. It needs to your get mobile number to sign up. Takes too much personal information for generating QR Code. Establishments in the ph don't require people to scan QR Codes or don't have QR Codes you can scan in the first place. Does nothing offline. You can't delete your account. People should leave honest reviews here.	1
17431	OTP is sent after hours	2
17432	The app doesn't appear to work on Android, everyone I know that has an iPhone gets a weekly notification and Android phones don't. When I go to the app setting and check the battery usage it's always 0 so doesn't appear to be running	2

17437	Hangs on Huawei Nova 7i and did not pass the OTP page. It didnt send out an otp as well. Please help. I believe Huawei P40 pro and Huawei Nova 7i is facing the same problem. Does this require Google services to pass through the OTP page?	1

17441	Nice! This is like a fast Corona test	0
17442	I have no problems at all with this APP	0
17443	A little disappointed. Downloaded the app on the first night it was released. On the third day after recharging my phone that morning, by the end of the day my phone went flat. Normally my phone's battery can last up to 2-3 days without recharging. So unfortuntely i had to uninstall the app because it was using up the battery life and i cannot keep my phone on charge during the day. Hoping this issue can be fixed.	1
17444	This app would be better if you were reminded to check with a notification. As I don't always remember. Also a more interactive dashboard that can drill down for more information.	1
17445	1. Having very frequent network issue error. Even thought my phone network is good. 2. Can't scan a valid QR code, which can be scanned by Singpass app. After advice to uninstall and reinstall, problem still persist. Also, can you locate the scan QR icon at the bottom of the app just like the singpass app. Thank you.	2

17447	If a graph of data reflected on dashboard could also be added, it would facilitate tracking the trend	1

17455	not working , just stuck without reason ,entering birth date is a problem also. needs to be checked and re-checked again.	2
17456	Could not complete registration as no OTP was sent to me. Please help!	2
17457	I downloaded after the latest update. Whenever I enter my NRIC details, a message comes - " Temporarily unavailable please try again later" I don't know how to fix it because without the details the app doesn't scan.	2
17458	I installed it, but I was getting an alert from the app that said my Bluetooth was off when I had been leaving it on. Maybe the app or other Bluetooth devices I was using interfered and switched the Bluetooth off. I couldn't remove the alert or turn the Bluetooth back on. I had to shut down the phone and restart. My phone is around 5 years old and an Android. It's not really usable for me.	2
17459	the app its not showing my name and my health status since Thursday morning	2
17460	Ive been using this since the whole Covid 19 started. Yes a color system would be nice. But beside the point. Why do you need my location for the app to run now? Seems stupid, cause its not like my location is all that important unless im self isolating or required to do so. So to have it needing a location for the app to function is totally unrequired (unless i was self isolating which at this point in time i am not nor do i need to).	2

17471	A couple of days ago, this app made my phone sick. It had a high temperature and didn't have as much energy as usual. By removing the app it started feeling a lot better, temperature went down, and its stamina returned. Now it's happy out and about.	1
17472	App gets stuck on entering the phone number. Spins a spins.	2

17485	This app will work with Bluetooth which is useless service. If we off the Bluetooth service then it cannot identify the Corona effected person. This app will notify the Corona effected person only if the effected person register this app otherwise this app cannot recognize. Dear Developers. Please take into consideration and find a solution to overcome this issue.	2
17486	After updating its not working	2
17487	Hi, i'm foreigner who marriaged with Singaporean this march, i just have passport and my LTVP is not yet approved and always got rejected maybe more than 5times, So when i sign up in trace together using passport, the check-in button doesn't show up, there is just share app button. So this app just for who have nric, ltvp, pr, or workpass right? Not for foreigner, i just wanna make sure., anw for this time i always use barcode scan, wanna try tracetogether, but Seems like it doesnt support my id	2

17492	I prefer the old version of TraceTogether. This version always disappear. I logged in, and dont know when, it just disappear. I didnt even turn off the bluetooth. By the time I realised it disappered, it is too late as I am already on the bus or already back at home. Just a feedback for improvement.	2

17508	Good	0
17509	App works well, except after last update its starting to have a lot of background battery usage, which is far from ideal on a tracking app, some optimization would be good to see regarding that. Update: google play services using 111% and covid tracker 40% battery, phone temp was super high, battery drainage was high, uninstalled and temp and battery drain are gone, please solve this issue fast so I can reinstall this app since it is a critical app nowadays.	1

17547	Issu to bahut h.. lkin free me nhi batayenge	0
17548	Seems pretty good. Does consume battery. I initially had issues because installing on a phone set with English as the language caused the activation to fail. It seems that issue was fixed quickly (a day or two) and now it works fine. Glad to have this now I'm going back out occasionally.	1
17549	Its interfering with all bluetooth connect devices	2
17550	Very good	0
17551	Works perfectly fine for me and doesn't interfere with Bluetooth. Sidenote: Registration on the app was not in operation for the first hours of the app being released, hence many of the negative reviews.	0

17553	Simple to use. Convenient for checking in and checking out. Good job indeed.	0
17554	Nice black theme implementation, I like it! Some of the preliminary text could be condensed and the full counterparts moved into menus though, currently it's long and tedious to read through. Once you're past that, the interface looks intuitive though. Good work!	0
17555	App crashes (white screen) instead of showing test results. Restarting phone, clearing catche or reinstalling the app does not fix the issue. My travel companion has the same problem on different android phone. That's very bad given how important it is.	2

17656	It didn't let me register. I work in a hospital mainly in ICU and I need a PERMISSION on daily basis 24/7. On Friday I got stopped while going to work because an officer was excited for this Tawakkalna and he asked me about it and when I said I have only my paper permission he didn't like my reply and started saying I should get..

17683	why not add a function where businesses can create a QR code and as you enter you scan the code which is stored in the Covid safe database. An additional level of data collection to overcome the bluetooth issue	2

17689	Would be useful but kills the battery.	2
17690	Still not 100% sure it is the app or just a huge coincidence. Ever since I have installed the app, my Bluetooth in the car gets momentarily disconnected. While it does reconnect, it is a real issue as it invariably happens during a call. If it keeps happening, I will uninstall and see if things improve.	1

17721	Can't even scan. It only appear a barcode with my name and ic number. That's all. Fake app.	2

17727	Stupid app and its still stupid. I can keep my bluetooth off and being on high risk but it will still display green. So yes once again its stupid and the initiative is stupid becuase a lot of people dont have multimedia cell	1
17728	It is a very useless app	1

17732	Went to Compass One last week, at the car park entrance, there is no SafeEntry QR code to scan. Try using the TraceTogether apps IC Barcode for them to scan, they say cannot scan, at the end, still need to use my NRIC.	2

17739	TOTALLY USELESS if you have a non-Turkish phone number. Since early June, everyone must have an HES code to travel within Turkey, but if you are foreigner you can't get it through this app unless you buy a local number. How are you going to do that if you are buying your ticket when you're out of Turkey, no idea. The only remaining option is to send an sms with your passport info to a short number, but depending on your current country it will be redirected somewhere else, so again no luck.	1
17740	This app is good but havr some problem	0
17741	App takes a long while to start and jumps back to Google Play everytime you try to register or login.	2
17742	Like any other's gov app which is free, this app is. Mediocre, I feel. Still don't know, why should make bluetooth on. It doesn't work on my wife's android.	1
17743	As the preferred contact tracing app by the government, I would have expected it to be highly functional. Yes, it can manage registrations and has the ability to collect symptoms data. Also, privacy rights are apparently protected when using the app. However, it does not work when scanning QR codes in establishments. I have tried in two separate establishments using the system but in both cases, it failed with an unknown error. I checked and the establishment has apparently registered with the system. I wanted to use in other establishments but only a few companies/government agencies are using it. Additional step-by-step instructions in-app may be required to assist new users.	0
17744	I have sent too many complaints, Radius Alert is not working properly. The tab is not showing cases.	2
17745	Very bad application, draining the battery.	1
17746	Took me a few days to discover the app was not active, and I'm a health care worker. Nothing looked unusual but location sharing was inexplicably turned off. Maybe the notification icon could look different depending on the app status.	2
17747	Works ok but can't use Bluetooth for anything else. Uninstalling.	0

17757	Excellent	0
17758	Good Cause but Poorly Optimize, make your phone become laggy, by consuming too much of a processing power of your phone even in standby mode.	0
17759	It's not yet worldwide availability	2
17760	It keeps requiring me to turn on Bluetooth. Wasting my battery.	2
17761	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0
17762	Has not done anything in 2 days total rubbish	1
17763	Not connecting very poor	1
17764	Battery drain.	2

17767	keeps stopping and doesnt auto start with phone start.	2

17782	No checks in two weeks according to phone settings. Open app to find it has been updated in the background and requires renewed consent to activate again - without prompting me! I've made sure to exempt the app from battery optimisation, but still it doesn't check in the background. Now it's 16 days since last check, so what is the point? Absolutely and utterly useless!	1
17783	While i have no issues with operations of the app i think 15 min of Bluetooth between contacts is far too long. 5 min more appropriate. As far as i know no tracing has been found by this app.	2
17784	Works as stated, smooth and concise. Bad reviews were just premature downloaders. Unlike facebook or instagram which you no doubt use and tag people in, this is not sharing that type of information with random companies. Delete it once this is over. Even for the safety of those around you, friends family and co-workers. Be responsible.	0
17785	Why does it keep on asking me to update the app when there is no option to update it?	2
17786	Excellent concept.	0
17787	It scans nothing. Useless to turn location and bluetooth on, because it does nothing. Thought the update would be precise and working. Maybe it's best for the gov't to not just launch it but to mandate the use of it so it can give real-time results of an area where we are in.	1
17788	Very good app & much needed.	0
17789	Requires GPS to be on. Fault reported and ignored.	2
17790	App should be available in English. International Travelers are a big risk factor and they need to be able to use the app. So even before accepting to any terms and conditions it needs to be possible to change to english and maybe some other languages. Otherwhise the app is useless.	2

17795	Very detrimental to other Bluetooth connections. Will now delete it. Get it right hey? This was probably too important to mess up.	1
17796	The app and OTP is not sync. 2 to 3 times the OTP is entered right but it says wrong OTP entered. So i am unable to even start to use this app.	2
17797	What a shame!!!!	1
17798	I can't enter my age. I am 64 years old. I tried.	2
17799	Not very valid and applicable app	1

17801	i love the premise of bluetooth tracing with privacy at heart, but why is a 3g connection required?? this is never explained and is by far what causes the most battery drain. its also underused, it is unlikely to be effective at this scale :(	2

17818	3 Jun, it was reported in ST that this app doesn’t work well on iOS and SNDGG doesn’t have any plan to use Apple and Google’s API. I wonder why?\nfurthermore, why NRIC issue date is required!?Too much private info needed for something that don’t work well. How secure is the app and the backend against hacking and data leaks that might happen in the future?	1

17830	Superb	0
17831	A very useful app. It would have been nice, if date of QR code generation is also incorporated in QR code image. In that way, more useful in emailing health data or health record storing purposes.	0

17873	Works as described but last update has messed up my notifications incredibly and i am not only one experiencing this	1
17874	This app is nice and fantastic to get daily statistics about Coronavirus. Currently I think it has some bugs that is why it crashes when radius alert function triggers. Some more features can also be included like visual representation of infected cases, deaths and recovered cases from its start to till date. It'll provide helpful information Like trend of new cases and death rate during different situations of lockdown and many more. Thanks and keep it up.	0

To do update IOS 3.0 Apple need to provide the updation. Second, I have tried in my another phone ; Redmi note 3. It's installed but during the time for acceptance of terms and privacy page, it's getting off and showing "Unfortunately Ehteraz stop working". Please advice what shall I do.	1
17964	Your Bluetooth function has drain my battery within a day. Very irritating, if it is not instruction by my management, i shall uninstall it.	2
17965	Congrats, the latest update completely glitches the displaying of all lockscreen notifications, rendering them unreadable. Thankfully I can simply disable the CovidSafe notification from appearing altogether, though this obviously defeats its purpose. Galaxy S9, Android 10.	0
17966	Whatever has happened this app is destroying the battery on my phone. I have had to charge it three times alone today.	1
17967	Wouldn't take phone number, so had to uninstall it! A lot of room for improvement left!	2
17968	Why do I give problems sometimes	2
17969	Installed this app when it was first released but it's caused so many issues on my phone, blocking Bluetooth, whatsapp messages and app downloads. I've tried it three times now and each time have had to uninstall after a few days as the reduced phone function is too impractical. Very disappointing.	1

17993	Warning about phone getting too hot.Really sorry to have to uninstall.Also draining battery	1
17994	I work in the epicenter of COVID-managing hospital, among confirmed cases with very close contact, and I didn't have a single notification to date. As long as this app depends on any individual downloading and reporting themselves, it's as useless as it could be.	2
17995	I have been waiting for it to download for the past 1 hour. And No, it's not my internet connection. I used my mobile data(M1) and unsuccessful after 15 mins. Just keeps showing "preparing to download" . And I switched to my Wifi (singtel) and it has been preparing for another 15 mins already. I hope you guys can fix this problem.	2
17996	When I'm connecting to any of my bluetooth devices for music, it will get interference from this app. Pls do something about it	2
17997	It was good until the battery will not charge up on my J5 Pro. After removing the app, the phone charges properly and I usually stay home anyway. Be careful everyone in case it doesn't charge your devices.	1

18008	App still won't work on my Oppo Reno . Gave the app another go after uninstalling 2 weeks ago. Still turns off after 10 minutes, no matter what my battery settings are.	1
18009	My phone used to need charging every 2 to 3 days as its a work phone. Now from 100% to 20% batt only half a day. Seriously? The new version of adding feature to inform user availability of a new version? Honestly it's a waste of time and resources isn't it? U load it up and google play store will inform all users there's a new update.... why do the double job?	1

18035	Battery usage why to high cause app. Phone was over heating deleted it...	1
18036	After installed app not opening on Samsung Galaxy m31 mobile.	2
18037	The app is good but it burns too much battery at the background. I understand that it uses Bluetooth to scan but i think it's needs more optimisation for battery usage. EDIT: still burns battery.	1
18038	super	0
18039	I still get an SMS telling me to install it every day even though I did. And developers, I understand it takes time to translate it, but will you simply allow people to take screenshots? Then at least we can use Google translate to scan the text. Anyway I'm a copywriter in quarantine with COVID, so get in touch with me, I'll translate it for free.	2
18040	Nice app and so helpful,easy to use and save our time, but some times mobile number varification taking long time	0
18041	Are we actually still using this? Like what's the point it drains the battery and sure I don't leave the house anyway, also looking at the numbers bearly anyone is using it. Put in like daily check-in rewards like a free chicken roll from centra!	1

18059	I turned off permission to access location info. Still waiting for promised access to source code before re-enabling.	2
18060	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0
18061	Like a lot of others my hubby and l finding app is draining battery and phone overheating. We were worried something wrong ie.virus, but at least we now know. Defference of opinion between us l feel important to keep Covid tracker as l check in every day and note if Cavan has gone up( 864 less than 2 wks ago and last night 881). Hubby has uninstalled his tracker. Battery drainage and overheating needs to be sorted, quickly otherwise if people keep uninstalling Covid app it will become useless	1
18062	Good, would be great if it didn't automatically select your system language. I like English for my setting but not on every single app i use ??.	0

18068	Drains battery way to fast. I think this app is not for those who are staying home. I am staying home for around 2 months now so it is useless for me. Good app for those who are going out for work. The access for Bluetooth is fine and location is also fine but storage permissions isnt the good idea. The storage permissions is for what checking root? I think its not required please stop asking for storage permissions.	1
18069	Ghost covid-19 tracker is amazing I can see everyday if I don't have covid-19 or if I have	1

18073	The app worked fine prior to the renewal of my QID.Now I get only a "?" and the app will not update.The 109 line is not very useful, as a rep never calls back.I have cleared app data, uninstalled, and reinstalled.Nothing.I have looked for a file named biotrace to remove but cannot find the location for that file.More info needs to be provided for how to completely uninstall the app and remove all traces of data,so that reregistration is required.	2
18074	Bit difficult	2
18075	Good	0
18076	Battery killer	1
18077	I need covid certificate	1
18078	The app uses Bluetooth (and a Apple, Google API) to log if you've been near someone else with this app installed. The app does not use GPS and does not know where you met someone, just that you met someone. It stores no information apart from optionally sharing your phone number. Information about who you have met is kept 100% on your phone unless you contract covid and voluntarily decide to share. I have noticed no decrease in battery life while using this app with Bluetooth on all the time.	2

18092	bad app, always not responding!	2
18093	Just sits in the background and seems to do nothing but eat my battery. Life went from 72hrs to 28hrs. Would be great if I could use the app to log into venues using qr code. Save pre-fill details, see where I have been. I would suggest give it more of a reason to download, that way more people can be tracked.	1
18094	My experience in ref to complaints by others: 1. Keeping the Bluetooth setting on does not eat up %of my battery. 2. Keeping the Bluetooth on does not interfere with my Bluetooth earpiece (using baseus, cheap brand) nor does it interfere with my car Bluetooth connection. I can still play songs on my phone via Bluetooth while tracetogether is still on. The only improvement I can think of is to show the list of place I've visited instead of the latest one.

18111	How to get more downloads on your app? 1) say its optional but highly recommended 2) force your conscripts into downloading it 3) ??? 4) PROFIT! What you gonna do? CHARGE ME LORH! But srsly, yes the pandemic is a serious problem. You guys can say you have state of the art security measures in place to prevent security breaches. But what you gonna do when it does get out? The most you can say is 'too bad we'll do better'. Is it a problem if ppl don't want to download it due to privacy concerns?	2

18161	This application mostly in a day not working because too much load check evening or night	1
18162	SMS not sending to me. I've checked and rechecked the number to make sure it is right and it is. I can't even get into the app.	2

I am so pathetic I have no WiFi at home, no phone data. That's what you telling me right? Now you telling us this app or your token is the only way do a safe entry check in/out?

Had to repeatedly attempt to scan 10+ times before it worked. Drained 25% of battery in 2hrs+. New Samsung Galaxy S20+ with latest firmware still have this issue. Update 23 Oct - Just noticed the app asks for permissions to know precise location and to read contents of storage card. WTH????	1

18199	Hi, i'm foreigner who marriaged with Singaporean this march, i just have passport and my LTVP is not yet approved and always got rejected maybe more than 5times, So when i sign up in trace together using passport, the check-in button doesn't show up, there is just share app button. So this app just for who have nric, ltvp, pr, or workpass right? Not for foreigner, i just wanna make sure., anw for this time i always use barcode scan, wanna try tracetogether, but Seems like it doesnt support my id	2

18254	Doesn't work properly. Checked it to see if it was still active on December 10th, and while it said "Active", it clearly was not because it reacted by downloading data and immediately giving me a warning that I had been in contact with an infected. I had not been outside at all that day, so I am left to conclude that this warning is potentially months old. So the app is apparently absolutely useless unless you check it daily.	2

18259	I am not able to download this app.kindly help me out	2
18260	When I downloaded the app first time it was working perfectly. Then when I tried to show the code in the food store it was asking to Update. I went back home and tried to update the app but unfortunately it stopped working. I deleted the app and treid to reinstall it but now the app is not working for me.	2

18273	Good idea but poorly designed. 1: Battery usage question and selection descriptions are ambiguous. 2: Should recognize stable "home" location and switch off Bluetooth until required by a change of geolocation or status. 3: Released prior to accepting registrations - dumb	1
18274	I had to remove the other day because of extreme battery drainage because of the app. But giving it another try now again as it is useful. But hopefully.wont happen again.	1

18289	Edit on Fri 11th Sept 2020: Issue seems to be resolved. No battery drain issue since downloaded again last week, thank you HSE and developers. PLEASE tell us when battery drain and phone overheat issue is resolved. Really want this app, but I'm not reinstalling and then waiting to see if it overheats and goes dead. At least give us an update on when likely to be ready again. SOME COMMUNICATION PLEASE ??	0

This status changes after 5 seconds to: "You can close this app and it will keep working." I am using android and really would like some feedback. Is olit working or not?	2
18328	Registration was easy. Well done app, only sends data IF you become infected AND you consent to data being shared - hopefully something very few of us have to worry about. Please everyone install this app.	0
18329	Not working	2
18330	Why.........Ehteraz? Because of new update, my phone's battery started draining....... Please fix this problem asap..........	1
18331	Within 2 hours of use, phone battery is down to 50%, there.is a slight heating of the phone since the App is always braodcasting.	1
18332	Technical team plz fix occurred problem exceed number call 109 please you must've give some reply also please	2
18333	I can understand the need for this app, but at the the moment; the cons outweigh the pros. On paper, using our devices to help pinpoint potential hotspots sounds like a good idea. But due to the fact that the app not only needs to always run in the background (even in power saving), it's constant access to location turning a 4day battery into 6 hours and consistent interruption of Bluetooth devices make this more of a hastle, rather then a utility. Please fix the Bluetooth and battery issues	1
18334	Utterly useless app	1
18335	No test results are available,, From past 3 days i am waiting for test results reinstalled multiple times,,, talked on help desk they said wait for 4 hours and reinstall app for covid report followed instruction but same problem.	1
18336	Easy to install, note you don't need to give your real name. Wouldn't you like to know if you have recently been in contact with a person with Covid-19?	0
18337	Unable to verify NRIC where do I resolve this.	2
18338	Optimize your app more... Kind of battery hog in my phone, because it was always requesting my location for 13hrs straight... There is no need for that... If you detect that we are not moving, give it a break... It is fine if we are in a trip, but a waste of battery if it isn't.	1

18352	Seems to have turned on flight mode on my Galaxy S20 Ultra when it has had a "handshake" with another phone with the app. This has happened twice and both times I was within bluetooth range of another phone. Having been in self imposed isolation, these two are the only occasions that I have been within bluetooth range of another phone for 15 minutes or more. Since the flightmode icon is so small, I didn't realise it was on for some time which was very problematic.	1
18353	Very slow process need improvement on the system	1
18354	When ever i am trying to make my account it is giving me error again again in getting OTP..i am a poor person.i cannot afford a high quality phone for this app.what should i do now.	2

18356	The idea of the app is good. However; The current implemantation method is inefficient since it relays only on the person's reporting of his +ve test result. It should be using the civil ID to synch with MOH records automatically for test results updates.	0
18357	Very slow to open the app	2
18358	The app is causing a much faster battery drain on my Samsung A70. It also causes my Bluetooth speaker to constantly drop connections for 30 seconds. This app completely takes over control of Bluetooth preventing me from turning off Bluetooth at night when I am home to save battery. These are things that I would not tolerate in any other app.	1

18403	The concept makes sense, but as with many others I too have noticed the last update has killed the battery life on my 4000mAh flagship phone, using far more than it did previously.

18492	Update 10.08.20: Deleted cache and all data from Google Play Services and battery use seems to have stabilised. Like the app but have would recommend some tweaks: - Daily confirmed cases graph covers too broad a timeline. Would be better to have a week by week option to show trends. - Cases/deaths stats should show daily or weekly movement comparisons. -Total cases per county is fairly meaningless, ignores population density for one.	1

18519	I scan some QR codes in some places and it can't work.	2
18520	Good	0
18521	Spastics are scared of it but my google home, siri and Alexa are way more insecure than this.	1
18522	False tracking. So what's the point? Can only cause panic.	1
18523	It was working fine when I first installed it. Now, all of a sudden it's telling me that there no internet connection. This happens when I'm connected to wifi or data. I've already tried to uninstall and reinstall the app with the same issue.	2
18524	Very very good	0
18525	Good	0
18526	I have registered in the app with correct information. But neither login nor forget password steps working. It shows "Please make sure that the information is correct". And there is no live support No chat how we resolved it, where we have to report bugs.	2
18527	I only downloaded this app because to enter cinemas you'll need to use TraceTogether from 16 Nov onwards and so I downloaded it and when you enter you particulars it just shows "Temporarily Unavailable" all the time I'm unable to use TraceTogether so honestly I think this app definitely contains a lot of bugs and needs to be improved. Honestly super disappointed because it's not the first time it has happened to me.	1
18528	Agree with other reviews. Battery drain started on 8th August is making my phone unusable. Will have to uninstall app which is a pity, as I think its a great idea.	1
18529	I cant registration, bcoz i haven\u2019t got my work permit card,i cant put crad serial nomber, how should i registered.. Plz help me	2

18545	Working fine, easy	0
18546	I've had no issues before. After the recent update, however, it now requires me to have location turned on for my phone (previously the app needed permission to access location, but didn't need it turned on). I don't want to turn location on, so I sort of wish I hadn't updated it now, as I'm now reluctant to do everything required to make it work.	1
18547	Bluetooth problem in the app, can't able to pair to other devices... everytime need to restart the mobile... plz update ASAP.	1
18548	I can't download it, how many hours I've waited	2
18549	Excellent idea\ud83d\udc4d	0
18550	They want to watch us 24/7. Which is a violation of human rights.	1
18551	Great apps to find out about covid spread for certain areas	0
18552	Again, on the android, the screen is not displayed properly. It is too large and is cut off. This was fixed for a day or so but again it is not displaying correctly. What good is the app if I cannot read what it sayd clearly.	1
18553	Proximity tracking doesn't work for xiaomi phones (miui/android operating system).	2
18554	Uninstalled because it drains my battery and I'm checking in everywhere anyway	1
18555	Nice app	0
18556	Finally gave in an downloaded this. Had to copy my code to add and all downhill since then. Can’t access any alpha or numerical keyboard to enter info. Two weeks to respond to this problem is failure in my books even though some update seem to fix the issue and I was able to add visits manually within 24hrs if loading it. So mixed feelings on benefits	1
18557	Cannot download to my phone i dont know what is the problem.	2

18560	Hi GovTech, may I know what's the rational for providing the NRIC date of issue?	2
18561	Drains the phone battery	1
18562	I downloaded the app and registered successfully with my emirates ID and mobile number. When I want to check my test result. It didn't show, It said My mobile number is wrong and need to log out. I had only one mobile number, and the mobile number that they show on the app is not mine. How is this possible?	2
18563	The App is draining the battery in a matter of hours since Friday 7th August. I have had to uninstall it until it is rectified.	1
18564	Useless support. Still waiting on a call back from the developer. It appears to think that I am not in NI & can't get passed that screen.	1
18565	Doesn't work on android	1
18566	I have been tested positive, but could not input the data in the app. How can other people be safe from me??	0
18567	Seems to work well, signup was straightforward and phone number verification worked. Zero issues with fitness trackers or Bluetooth headphones on a recent Samsung phone.	0
18568	Server is not responding	1
18569	As others have said already it doesnt seem to stay active unless the app itself is open, that's why it gets a one star review because it's useless as it is. If it is any help to the developers it only seems to stop working once I have put my phone on standby, not sure if it's the same for others. I can't be leaving my phone unlocked 24/7 though while im walking around. It looks nice and I want to do my part to help but until this is sorted its just dead weight.	2

18575	It only mention the red zone of covid 19 in your area. Not much information. It should mention how many suspect in area.	1
18576	Could have been way better. the features are okay. but its hardly usable because of how bad sometimes the system crashes.	1
18577	App is working well. Scanning is lightning speed. Does not draw a lot of battery from my phone. Well done Dev Team! :)	0
18578	Terrible app besides draining battery 3 times the rate, it interferes with fitness app synckng with your fitness tracker. Rendering all your fitness tracking app useless. To assist tracing you have to give up the base functions of what you use your phone for.	1
18579	Nice	0

18591	Dropped out due to weather ??? And now the app wont turn my blue tooth on..	2
18592	A very simple and important app. Most of my other apps collect my data so that it can be sold to advertising companies. This one will hopefully prevent and slow the spread of a global pandemic. Seems worthwhile to me.	0

18597	Need to improve the functionality. Di pa sya fully developed, more on graphical user interface palang yung nakikita namin. Need to fix bugs, errors and database for effectiveness of this app. Do some surveys or studies if needed, magdagdag ng developer kung kailangan, kasi malaking tulong talaga to sa panahon ngayon and please wag po sanang sayangin ang budget at time habang may panahon pa. We are expecting the good outcome of this.	1

18622	The permanent icon is a little annoying, but just like the software update notification you get used to ignoring it.	2
18623	I had trouble registering my phone number, the app said it was invalid. I disabled Wifi on my phone, just used my phone data instead, and was then able to register without any problems.	2

18638	After the latest update (2.0.15), there seems to be something wrong with the number of 'exchanges' with other trace together users. Previously, even visiting downstairs to the supermarket would show something like 25 exchanges. Today, I went to home team NS adventure centre for my swab test, even after returning my app says 0 exchanges. The app status says it's working fine in the notification box. I've also got Bluetooth turned on by default. Something is wrong.	2
18639	I don't have QID, I am on work permit visa. Plz allow user to register based on their visa number.	2

18653	App stop working, right after the registration.	2
18654	My bluetooth earphone or speaker is effected after installing this app. Every few minutes, my music will pause then play. This went on again and again until I uninstall this app. I would very much like to install this app to help but I cannot go without my music. Battery also drain extremely fast. I usually charge my phone once a day but after installation, I need to charge 2 to 3 times a day.	2
18655	Too many fields to fill in. Why can't we use singpass mobile to login? If the fields are not filled in, we can't even use the app. good idea, but implementation could be better Just tried to sign up again. But it says my IC is invalid??!!	2
18656	The app is not working in many Android phone s i wonder why the ministry have even approved it to b in action. Many people out thier are facing difficulty to either install it or the otp is not coming. I would really like to raise my concern for this issue to the ministry \ud83d\ude4f.	2

18663	Is this app only for covid positive people???	1

18665	I use the app and check in daily. An improvement might be that if a user gets a positive test result they should be able to enter a code immediately as waiting for contact tracing call doesn't happen for a few days after so app is only notifying contacts of previous 10-11 days no 14	0
18666	Can't even register... So the app doesn't qualify for a rating...	2
18667	Easy to install. Happy with privacy issues	0
18668	Please help. i am travelling to Singapore from Vietnam in a few days times and i am not able to receive OTP for this trace together app to be installed. I register \u00faing my VN mobile numbet. Kindly provide an email AND contact number that I can reach the appropriate Singapore Government entity.	2
18669	Best application	0
18670	how come on iphone, trace together app can create group login in, and not on android platform ?	2
18671	I downloaded this app but realized it does not make any sense - what are the chances that someone who is positive would actually be kind enough to enter their random code? Sadly the way humanity is today, most people are very self-oriented and concerned with own privacy more than their immediate surroundings and society. \n\nI would be more than happy to have such app if it would alert me and others of potential contact without relying on faith that people would actually volunteer to share their codes. Make it mandatory to share - and that is how we can help control this virus...	1
18672	Can't relate to the complains about a bug. It "bugged" twice for me until I understood that I'd keep my bluetooth on. It deactivates itself if you stop it. More useful than previous app showing statistics and linking to certificate.	1
18673	Poor quality apps.	1

18691	The app is fine but what I dont understand is why do you need storge and phone call access and keep the bluetooth on? GPS tracking should suffice to know where the person has been, having gps turned on all the time drains the battery and having bluetooth on as well drains the battery even more	1

18697	Lots of figures but no guidance about where to avoid to minimise exposure. I am over 70 and I complete it every day but feel it is wasting amazing technology. LEA figures are an improvement but still too broad. I go to mainly supermarkets in Malahide, Portmarnock, Swords but theres no guidance on which is lowest risk for me. I can't go to pubs so it is only supermarkets and the app is no help.	1

18731	Initially when downloaded was not able to register due to "Service Unavailable" error. However, was able to register later.	1

18743	After enter phone number for otp, system no response and no otp send to my phone. Hanged. Till now still can't use	2
18744	Tries to grant root permission itself, looks like spy software. Do not install it if your device has been rooted.	1
18745	Battery optimization on the app needs to keep being switched on or app doesn't run, even if there's no power saving mode on.	1
18746	It's very informative app and a Good initiative by our government.	0
18747	This app on Android causes issues with notifications. It is not market ready. Uninstalled after the second try with both resulting in delayed notifications and unorganised timings for them.	1
18748	Ever since the last update, I find that the app drains my battery faster.  If an app murders phone battery, and I’ve a dead phone before 3:30 pm, it’s gone.  After uninstalling, even after moderate use throughout the day I’m still sitting at 53% after 5 pm.	1
18749	Seems to be pretty unobtrusive to me, but my wife's phone is just a bit older and has Android 5 with no update pushed from Telstra. The initial version needs Android 6 or later.	2

18759	I appreciate that our safety is being prioritised, however, this app is very, very heavy on the phones. My battery keeps heating up and is loosing power in less that 1 hour. I'm not sure why it requires access to my private media and files but it definitely needs to be altered.	1
18760	Having to have Bluetooth always on is draining my battery, it is also telling me to turn battery optimisation on when it already is on. Will be deleting as I am not confident in its effectiveness yet.	1

18796	A great initiative by our government but the programmers should consider to update the app to run in the background. \n\nI don’t think the older generation is aware that you have to have the phone ON at all times for this app to work and that they should use the “power save mode”. If while having a meal at a restaurant, and your phone’s screen turns off, the app will not work based on the “power save mode” instructions. \n\nIt is also currently unclear if we need to be on the app at such times or can it run while whilst we are on other apps? \n\nI hope the app can improve soonest! \nThank you for working tirelessly in the meantime!	0
18797	This Trace together app should auto-check out when we scan a new place to check in at a new venue..because we won't be at the previous venue again unless we re check in again..	1
18798	Good	0
18799	V.good app thanks	0
18800	Very helpf	0
18801	The app is a battery drainer, there's no two ways about it. I use an automation app to disable bluetooth when I'm at home and re-enable when I leave home. That's made a world of difference to my battery life.	1
18802	This ia hopeless. I registered via website but I cannot log in through the app, account has been locked out and there's no way to reset the password since I register using Facebook.	2
18803	Update: App is now working after June 9th update. - 3 stars for being utterly intrusive. __________ Previous review: Bought a new phone (Android 10) just to download this dumb and INTRUSIVE app. Wasted money. Dumb app won't open.	0
18804	Won't download on my son's Samsung as it says his device is incompatible, and it won't download on my Huawei.	0
18805	Good	0
18806	Not bad. But it'll be nice if we could have the qr code reflected in the smartwatch and scan like making an e-payment.	0
18807	There is no group entry option on Android phone \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb	2
18808	What a waste of time and money. Over $1.7 million went to non Australian companies to pay for the app and no cases have been found that have already been found with manual tracing. The Australian government could have at least used Australian companies for the job. Yet another waste of taxpayer money.	1
18809	Still learning stage.	2
18810	Easy to use	0
18811	Recently, with the recent updates, it has been draining the battery on the phone, quite significantly. I know some apps that collect logs eventually start to consume more power as the logs increase in size. Just a guess	1
18812	The app informs you of the presence of a positive subject around you. IF that person also uses the app, IF they have declared themselves, and IF their app is running. Useless. Worst, the button the stop using it on the user interface DOESN'T WORK. You need to go through the phone settings to delete the application.	0
18813	So nice	0
18814	Please improve the apps to have it OFF when not in USE such as at home rather then pause for 8hr as the apps and bluetooth are running the Phone Battery and Data which is a waste of $ as you do not need to trace in at your own HOME	1
18815	Very good app	0
18816	Had to uninstall and reinstall - I wonder if anyone else had to do that and if they take those into account when disclosing 5m people have installed it?	1

18819	Great idea!	0

18821	Nice	0
18822	The app always closed by itself. If the app is closed by itself and unaware it will not track. Then it will be useless.	2
18823	Just Uninstalled as I haven't been able to use this since June when they've required ID details. I've tried many times to register with my NRIC details but I keep getting the validation failed error. I'm not the only one as many of my friends have the same issue.	2
18824	Since latest update it's been killing my battery - second charge within 24 hours with fairly light use so had to uninstall it. Don't know why I even had it installed as I rarely leave the house!!!!	1
18825	Awesome	0
18826	Works great with my phone, sad to hear others with different phones have issues	0
18827	it takes ages to update. waste my battery life	1
18828	Post recent update this app has stopped working. I tried input my details but all times it shows error " service not available". Very disappointing. Govt makes it mandatory but app itself is not good.	2
18829	After the latest update the app doesnt open and keeps on closing. Kindly look into it. EDIT:-Was fixed in the next patch but the recent update introduced the same issue	2
18830	Thanks for the reply. I did the right process but app said my nric need verification....haha.	2
18831	Great App. But it drains the battery	0
18832	good apps	0
18833	Unable to verify NRIC where do I resolve this.	2
18834	Update app to min android v8 and above so that Bluetooth does not require location. Alternatively, on devices running Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher, you can use the CompanionDeviceManager to perform a scan of nearby companion devices on behalf of your app without requiring the location permission.	2
18835	The app is a positive contribution to the fight against CV, but there really needs to be an audible notification for the photo requests. Without one, users are likely to miss the requests unless they are prepared to stare at their phones all day.	1
18836	Failed to verify with the OTP received. Gives up after many tries as it doesn't work.	2
18837	Unable to register. It gives an error message.	2
18838	When ever I downloaded TraceTogether it shows Waiting for Downloading any problem needs help	2
18839	Update stuck at 83% nothing happens maybe waiting to drain my data. Very disappointing.	1
18840	I have given up trying to install as I can't get past my mobile phone number. No starts but it wouldn't let me post without a star rating.	2
18841	Huge battery drain, charge does not last the day :(	1
18842	Downloaded app but cannot uplaload. Kept telling me invalid pin. But how to get the valid one?	2
18843	Application is good but the radius alert is not showing cases correctly. In my surroundings there are few places where cases are reported but they are not identified on map. Kindly improve this and add current and recovered numbers seperately.	2

18848	After update suppose to allow student to register but it is not working. That way by selecting NRIC works. Thanks.	2
18849	It really put a massive drain on my phone. Had to delete as I couldn't get through the day on one charge anymore	1

18858	On several occasions, when I want to leave my workplace late in the evening after spending about 12 hours there, the last check-in is no longer showing on my home screen, so I was unable to do a check-out. Is there a flaw?	2
18859	It's really big step from Bahrain government	0
18860	Useless app. For months i have been trying to use this app. It only state no internet connection inspite of my phone data being active. No wonder theres a long Q to get the token when the government makes it compulsory to use them soon. The matter is resolve by updating app. Anyway i hv already taken the token.	2

18867	I have a phone Xiaomi Redmi note 8 pro. It is crashing all the time. Not possible to open. Because I received new update for Android 10. Luckily I read it all reviews and one guy posted that just to go on app info and allow to install from unknown source. And it works. It should not be like this. This app should work with all upgrades from Android 10.	2
18868	I even can't download the application. It's just 99%. Never 100%.	2
18869	This is your official application? and sometimes it doesn't work	2
18870	Keep prompt OTP incorrect, use NRIC also errors.	2
18871	Very Nice	0
18872	I download this app with my Emirates I\u2019d number and mobile number I have only 1 number and when I open its shows my number is not registered and the other number that showing is not mine it\u2019s saying wrong credentials logout.but one thing pure health send msg for my test result in my number	1
18873	Brilliant idea! But sorry i dont seem to be getting OTP. How to rectify this? Pls advise how else can i register thks.	2
18874	Too much stupidity ?? I installed it then after uninstall the app.Its Not useful to detect any Covid-19.	1
18875	Hasn't done anything	1
18876	Please add a QR Scan Widget if you are to make this app mandatory. Additionally, since it's not possible to physically be at 2 places at the same time, why doesn't a new "check in" (in a new place) automatically check you from the previous place?	2
18877	Fantastic	0

18882	It looks like from the 8th of August people are reporting phones overheating and batteries draining. This is happening to everyone in my household and the covid application is causing the problem. This is extremely serious because people will just uninstall the app if it's killing their batteries. Developers please take note and fix this urgently.	1

18889	Server not responding	1
18890	Very low quality app. ??????	1
18891	I'd downloaded because it's feature of 'Radius Alert' which is not working now. There's nothing special in this app other than that.	0
18892	Random alert for Bluetooth keeps coming up and disappearing	1
18893	Excellent	0
18894	A well designed app with privacy and user experience at heart. Uses the Apple contract tracing API. No GPS permissions are asked for. I don’t understand how people can install Facebook, Instagram, Google Maps etc etc (all track your location) and not want to install the one app that could save you, you friends and family from disease. Let’s all download this app and help rebuild our community’s and our country!\nThis app does not work on older unsupported versions of iOS because it has user privacy baked into the operating system. The alternative for unsupported iOS versions is location tracking, server stored data and poor battery usage, which no one wants!	0

18907	Eventually OTP sent and I was able to register/start the app. Thanks for helping to keep us safe!	2
18908	Great that you have gotten this to work. There need to be a language selector. I have my phone set to English and I want to use the app in Swedish but it defaults to Finnish and no way to change it. Otherwise great job.	0
18909	Great way of implementing this app with peoples privacy at the forefront. Amazing tech and genius way of deploying this type of alert system this.	0
18910	Good	0
18911	Great Idea, But Major Flaws MUST be attended immediately. Service should be accessible to ALL people in our country, currently this app cannot be activated with VISITORS details. It is a major drawback. and Compatibility issues, with Black Berry, IOS under 13, android under 6 etc. Developers should work on it, or else it will be useless. (think about a COVID person in Visit Visa, and his primary contacts ... )	0
18912	very good app.	0
18913	Completely useless app. In my area we have 4 patient positive with covid-19,this app don't show any of these info at all. Even my nearest sample collecting center which is not even showing. This is most the biased app I've ever seen.	1
18914	Very easy to install, not sure why some users are having difficulty with the phone number, it accepted mine straight away (with leading zero). Maybe you need to have your number registered on myGov?	0

18925	This app interfere with my Bluetooth earbuds! My earbuds keeps getting disconnected after some time when I turn on trace together app but when I turn off, everything works.

18930	Covid tracing apps should be very low on battery use. I have used and tested multipe national apps, and the French tous anti covid is the single app that drains the battery, making it very undesirable for average public to use. Seconds critique is that it needs manual activation. Most other apps automatically activate once Bluetooth is on. Why force the user to open the app and activate? I like the statistics page and useful links.	1
18931	Quite happy nowing what this can mean to me and my family.. at work as i take temps at vline pod a.all staff and visitors. Haven't had any problems with high temps at all. Thank god.	2

I must kill this app in order my other Bluetooth devices can work properly. Already many complaints about this. Fix this. No need to reply back this review by asking email to your support, OS version, screen captures and such things. Please take seriously before forcing people to use this.	2
19051	Found it was watching everywhere I go. Working in information security, I found it troubling and removed.	1

19060	Very bad app. I have not seen this like of stupid app in my life. This app doesn't work properly. When I open this app it doesn't shows if there is any covid-19 positive around me. It just shows please wait. I recommend everyone not to install this app.	1
19061	Such a waste of tax payers' money. Keeps crashing, I have to re-open it every time. I'm a developer myself and I'm truly ashamed of this rubbish.	1
19062	Good idea but impossible to enter data directly into app - have to cut and paste from another app as keyboard will not come up on phone. For an app designed to be used on a phone very frustrating.	1

19075	I wondered why my phone was suddenly unable to go a full day without charging. Turns out since the last update, this app has started using a lot more battery charge. Needs to be fixed asap or I will have to uninstall it, and I won't be the only one.	1
19076	The app does not work for the newest version of Android. I bought a new phone just for this app and now I cannot even open the application after installing it. It suddenly closes right after opening it so I can't do anything. Please fix this issue as soon as possible.	2
19077	Unable to obtain OTP using my Zero1 mobile line. Have no issue using my Singtel line on the same mobile phone previously.	2

19112	Like what some other users said, this app gave me problem when listening to music, watching videos and playing games while using my Bluetooth earbuds. Never have this problem before installing this app. Have to pause the app to make this problem goes off.	2
19113	Doesn't work, always says network issue when trying to get otp for the first time...	2
19114	I got a notification that I was exposed to covid and then the next day, the app said I had not been near anyone with covid that used the app. \n\nI got tested anyways but am a confused / concerned on whether I’ve been exposed	1

19119	App is working, but draining away a lot of battery in phone, forcing me to charge in the middle of the day. I have tried restarting as well, doesn't help.	1
19120	Why no auto update	1
19121	The installation and registration process was easy. Running the app is a small contribution to having the pandemic under control.	1
19122	Garbage. I appreciate the purpose of this app, as another user started, it interferes with in-car Bluetooth paring. Calls don't come thru. I'll run the app if the govt want to pay my fines for using my phone while driving... Considering this has been rammed down our throats. You could at least make it play nice with other devices-. I'll try installing again in a month, to see if it's fixed.	1
19123	It works fine!	0
19124	It is a best app it helps to us more	0
19125	I am not being able to add my number and hence create my account. This is getting very annoying because I need the application for an exam. Please respond ASAP and fix this bug!	2
19126	Easy install. I always have Bluetooth off unless connected to headphones, so breaking that habit will be difficult. This doesn't work unless Bluetooth is on. Anyone with privacy concerns, none here, but I hope you have turned of GPS location tracking. I'm not sure those people who are concerned about privacy are even aware their location data is being tracked and stored. See Google Maps TimeLine, which I use. Personally I would favor a more aggressive contact tracing app for the case of Corona.	0

19132	This app occasionally cuts off Bluetooth devices when it is enabled. It gets annoying very quickly. Occasionally embarrasses you when the music on your phone speaker suddenly plays aloud after temporary disconnect.	2

19140	Horrendous battery performance. For a "mandatory" app you'd think they would do a better job	1
19141	Battery life. 33 percent battery drained after unplugged from charger this morning. Probably 30 mins? The version is 2.3.11	1
19142	The app is pretty good. I've nothing to complain about other than the battery drain, but I realise that there's no way around that. I do think though that there should be an added page on it to show you the current restrictions on place for your location (like the currently locked down counties, Kildare, Louth, and Offaly). It's hard to find one source that tells you everything you need without having to trawl through loads of news stories before getting to official sources	0

19144	I have installed, registration & viewing the status is good, but its make bluetooth on and makes mobile heat with battery down as soon, please fix the issue.	1

19199	Nothing tells me how this app will alert me or what an alert looks or sounds like through my smart phone, when or if I come into contact with someone "registered as a Covid 19" person. An Extremely ambiguous app that doesn't make sense as far as explanation around it's practicality.	2
19200	When I need to start this app it is. Automatically closed	2
19201	Today's update (July 23) has fixed the "white screen" bug. I am now able to see my test results OK. Hurrah!	0
19202	Concept is great but poorly made. Drains battery on S7 within a few hours.	1
19203	Invalid phone number message error. Regardless if you include a 0 before the number or not, once it says your phone number is invalid you are stuck. Also why include +61 in the number given that it is only for Australia.	2
19204	Would be better if can incorporate checking in with family function like in singpass. Otherwise still no incentive to the safe entry function in TT	2

19216	My review disappeared, so here's another. This app does not appear to work on bbk phones (Oppo going by reviews here, and Realme going by my own experience with my Realme X2 Pro). It tells you it's not active and battery optimisation needs to be switched off. And you do that, use another app and it's inactive again. Still not fixed, and it's mid November.	2

Its a very important app, requires support in such circumstances. Can someone attend to this pls	2

19330	The application stops at the very beginning. Every time at the same exact spot. I am using SM-T287 tablet android 5.1.1 kernel version 3.10.65-7470279. Dont know if this will be useful for the developers but I have to say, there should have been done enough tests with available tools before publishing.	1

19339	Hi there, I m using xiaomi Redmi K20 Prond after the latest MIUI update, my TraceTogether stop working in the sense that it is unable to dony Bluetooth exchange. Had verified using the same TraceTogether account with another phone and it still works well. Please kindly see if it is this new MIUI was not accounted for, thanks!	2
19340	Can't open and operate Apply for the first time for permission and it is granted and now it is not showing	2
19341	Stupid app, very annoying	1
19342	I wanted to do the right thing and installed it but then found I could not connect to the car Bluetooth, so I ended up uninstalling.	1
19343	This app is a scam in terms of contact tracing. It's as good as a phone directory, relying on manual inputs. The Bluetooth functionality is the biggest scam of this app. It claims it records Bluetooth of other devices, but this is a complete lie. If Bluetooth really does work in this app, then why isn't any of my device discoverable even while the app is open? ?? Stop selling lies for publicity.	1

19353	very good, helpful	0
19354	Excellent app since the update As some feedback would be useful if you were able to change your status once you've checked in IE presses the "I'm feeling good" button, if you check in say in the afternoon but then don't feel good later that evening there's no way for you to change your status you have to wait until the next day for the options to reappear.	0
19355	It crashes, cant open even after restarting the phone need to fix or take help from some chinese technical team.. \ud83d\ude20	1
19356	Got completely logged out & had to enter user & password. Whether this is due to update in app I don’t know but could lead to people pretending to scan the Covid posters.  I entered visits manually, but busy people might give up, or simply have no time! Apart from that the iPhone app works well.	1
19357	Very useful and comprehensive app in present days scenario. It gives accurate and timely update with simplicity and precision. Highly recommended to be used untill stop over of spread of CoVID-19. Excellent effort by the government.	0
19358	Predictably infuriating. Won't accept mobile number, can't register.	2
19359	Not working	2
19360	It never works when I need it to work for the god sake i can't attend my exam without it working properly but still liie nooo every time i must apologize to the guardians and feel ashamed od my self.	1

19368	Now everyone wear a mask. Really the app's good but wearing (and washing) a reusable mask is actually a practical thing everyone can do to keep the curve going in the direction. This will mean that this app will not be needed that would be a great result.	0
19369	Great!	0
19370	Good	0
19371	Many people don't understand their security settings. Location includes capability to use bluetooth (seeing surround bluetooth devices can be used to determine your location). The app functions are expected. The perma-notification is somewhat annoying but a small price to pay. Having also reviewed the source code, this app is good to go and we should all be on board.	1
19372	Good information and suggestion for me about covid-19	0
19373	There should be current active cases mentioned in app dashboard	2
19374	Invalid NRIC all the time cannot lock in? Try for months already How can my NRIC be wrong stupid app. i cannot log in its say my NRIC is invalid	2
19375	Good	0
19376	Best if can add qr scanning safe entry to it. Then we can just scan in and scan out rather than scan to go web to submit and nobody scan out. Just like office punch card. The app is running all the time might as well add some functionality to it.	2
19377	right away crashing at the launch	2

19391	Works well and with no privacy issues. There are things that could be improved. 1. A reminder each day to check in. 2. A map with current hot spots so the rest of us can avoid them. 3. Current (local) restrictions. 4. More stats so we can see how things are progressing 5. Breakdown stats are out of date. A recent update did provide more, but the graphs on the Wikipedia are still better. e. g. in the first spike the number of people in hospital was the big warning of the forthcoming death rate.	0
19392	last update has ruined this app .. it doesn't work anymore	2

19466	Good App	0
19467	Had the app for a while but only just recently uninstalled due to all of a sudden high battery usage.	1
19468	I am from Scotland and I deleted this app, the reason for this is when I installed app it says enter a mobile number, the number is foreign and its only 8 digits long, while UK starts +44 then 11 digit numbers, so since it doesn't work for Scotland or UK I ended up deleting it because can't even get by the first phase.	1
19469	Keeps turning off. Very frustrating. I'll download it one more time, then if still not working, i'll delete it.	1

19489	Hi, in the last 30 hours my Samsung A5 keeps reporting that Covid App is hogging CPU and phone needs to be restarted. Indeed a full battery charge is drained in a few hours and phone is very hot to touch. I checked online, did a few things like cleaning Google play service cache etc. Even Unistalled Play service updates but still the same. In the end I had to uninstall Covid App which is NOT something I want to do. You guys wrote this App. You need to investigate and revert clear message.	1
19490	Unable to be installed on my phone. Other than Apple and Google services, can include the app into Huawei Mobile Services too? I have asked several times on this issue already.	2

19505	It is very practical, easy-to-use ... But the oy negativesideisthat the phone number never reply answer back. Please.

19525	My wife and I cannot even register, despite receiving and entering the correct OTP required at sign up. The app keeps saying we are registering with the wrong number, and suggests we register with another (masked) number that we don't even recognize.	2
19526	Nice	0
19527	I gave one star because you cannot disable the notification and consume battery power.	2
19528	Cannot download for Samsung J1 phone	2

19539	UAE advised (As per gulf news)us to download this app to find out our COVID-19 test result, (i have tested from ph screening centre Abudhabi ) on 29th april2020 which is still showing NOT TESTED. May be it is for specific hospital use not for everywhere uae.	1
19540	Why does this app need access to personal data e.g photos, calls, messages etc? And why does it matter that device is rooted or jailbroken?	1
19541	Doesn't open	2
19542	After installing it takes too much power my phone easily survive two day's without charging after this app it on power saver at 4pm first day	1

19548	Good	0
19549	I can't start it. I have to try my number, onother number, registered number & own internet & high speed wifi also. Always getting the same message "error getting OTP, try again " and this "try again" never ends. With such an important app in the current scenario. How can we follow the state's orders if the app doesn't even work?!	2
19550	App isn\u2019t working - it tells me my details are not correct.it wont accept my phone number which is correct,	2
19551	Doesn't work on iphone11 not sure if because it needs internet connection to scan QR code, but if it does I wonder why that option wasnt given. Should allow you to scan and just update your profile when internet connection is available. Will keep it in my phone for a while and update it but if it still doesnt work in a week or 2 after updates will remove it as its just pointless to have it in my phone and can't use it	1
19552	Keeping the Bluetooth on from morning to evening drastically affected the battery and with every update its unpredictable. I am confident on the privacy of the app what it's been claimed, but the battery drains faster in crowded areas like malls and MRTs. In an emergency if the phone is off due to low battery, who will be accountable?	1
19553	Worst app	1
19554	I am using Samsung Note 8. After I downloaded the app, the BT connectivity with other BT devices was impacted. Cannot detect or no connection. Update the app several times but problem remain.	2

19562	I installed I started. I accepted the TC .. then I got message "Unfortunately, EHTERAZ has stopped". My mobile screen freezed. Trial so many times for the same result. Shall I buy advance mobile such latest Samsung Note or Iphone? My present mobile is Samsung Note 3, which I love it so much. Right now I uninstalled the aps. Please advice. Thank you.	2
19563	While out and about on a full working day, with numerous SafeEntry check-ins and check-outs, the app reported ZERO (0) Bluetooth exchanges, even though there were many encounters with others. Surely, it is improbable that all these people are not using TraceTogether. During the day, I had my phone paired via Bluetooth to my smart watch. If I can't use TraceTogether with other Bluetooth devices, then it is not totally unacceptable.	2

19592	I had hoped that this app would provide useful timely and accurate information to users. Instead I see that the statistics are not kept up to date. By way of example today is 05/11/20 but the R number estimate is from 16/10/20. Come on people for the sake of credibility must do better!	2
19593	It's not working always prompt me temporarily unavailable.	2
19594	Super aap	0
19595	Enabling bluetooth and running in the background at all times is not only detrimental to the battery life of the device, but also opens up a hole in the device's security. I knew I was taking a gamble by downloading this app, taking in account the experiences I have had with other government applications, but now I am sure that I shan't ever download one of these things again. It's simply appalling.	2
19596	Why need to get access to media files.. it violates privacy.. I think its not relevant to give access to files and has nothing to do in combatting covid-19.	1
19597	Very Good App in the world	0
19598	Nice	0
19599	Why only show question mark? Even if i uninstall and intall? And i try to call 109 2x not answer?	2
19600	5stars for an older version.. the new updates are worthless and it's not responding... And showing all the time close aap or wait or send feedback... please fix the problem as soon as possible.	1
19601	I download the app, put my phone number in and it said invalid number. I don't know why but it is so hard to use. Tried many times but still fail	2
19602	Why isn't it working unable verification code in filled	2
19603	Using this app completely drains your battery and makes your phone overheat to bits.	1
19604	Unable to register. OTP didn't work. I input into the app the exact code received via SMS but the app says invalid code	2
19605	Needs to be improved: The app after activating it puts a permanent notification on the phone and if I remove it, the app stops tracking. Also, the app does NOT work with the official Google Api (exposure notifications). Please enable integration ASAP. This way we make sure exposure tracking and notification is secure, private and reliable.	2
19606	Good	0
19607	In theory: great idea In practice: horrendous. Privacy invasive, breaks bluetooth, crashes constantly, doesn't automatically start at boot most of the time, drains battery life at places like a school, does in app updates which breaks itself. I get you need to have an app like this but Google and apple has added contact tracing into their os, and from what has been said it works better.	0
19608	Great base to build upon with future updates it's a smart way to do contract tracing but only works if we all use so share to and follow the government's guidelines	0
19609	Thanks for fixing the bug	0
19610	App drains power, any fixes to the app for next release Why bluetooth need to be always on? Can't it only be manually switch on by user when using the App? Why App must always run at the background?	2
19611	Helpful to keep you safe from Covid-19 by making you aware of potential Covid-19 cases in vicinity & thus one can take required action to save himself and also his family.	0
19612	The apps always drop....what went wrong?	2
19613	Do you trust the government with your data? How confident are you that it will be kept safe? What safeguards are there that the data isn't being used for some other purpose?	2
19614	After reinstalling, feeding the correct data, tried to get yhe verification pin but in vain, tried more than 30 times in the last 3hrs, no use, called technical team, only 6 people in waiting, cannot answer, poor customer service, said will take 2hrs to attend, overall getting irritation and frustrated.	2
19615	Easy to use. Great work by the Gov	0
19616	This apps not working only green wallpaper. nothing else.	2
19617	Absurd. You make it mandatory for foreign visitors to install the app, but then you only take a +91 Indian phone numbers during the registration process.	2

I had not been to any medical facility or been tested for Covid ??? So a think there is a glitch somewhere and I have now opted out...	1

19635	Happy to help my community	0
19636	The recent update is able to address the problems generated by the previous versions. I almost wanted to uninstall the app. Lucky the update came in time. Ver 2.3.8. The TT is the best when it comes to SafeEntry QR code scanning. Easily detects from a distance. Smooth entry and exit. Hope the subsequent updates will not cause any more issues.	0
19637	Very good app	0
19638	Those saying they can\u2019t get their number recognised, have you tried leaving off the leading zero? Because the app has the +61 at the front this usually means you enter your phone number without the leading zero. I imagine they\u2019ve put the 61 there to ensure that only Australian numbers can participate, which is sensible. I left off the leading zero and got in straight away with no issues at all.   I think this app is a great initiative. I\u2019m not worried about the so called problems of authorities knowing where I am. They can already do that anyway through the phone\u2019s location service and through the gps on my car. This is designed for better tracing of who you happen to be around in the shops or at work or wherever, to meet the response to the virus, so I\u2019ll support it.	0

19643	No net on phone mean no tracing also if Bluetooth is off then can't trace !! Net is still very expensive here in Bangladesh!! So ICT ministry should refill net on infected ppl & should ask them to turn net on their phn. Only Allah knows ?-? ?????? ?? ??? ???? ?? ???? ?? ???? ???? ??? ???? !!	0

19660	I downloaded the CovidSafe application to Nokia 9 OS: Pie. There seems to be no initial problems with the program. However, there is no Exposure Notification badge. It reacts to the deactivation of Bluetooth, via silent notification. Reminder: To activate when you leave home or visit a public place. There is no threat to device security, the app has limited access. Our hyena or wessel-trait individual's wouldn't declare themselves sick, unless hospitalised. Review by Protonumus [YouTube]	1

19692	Beware! Using this app prevents Google Play Store from downloading updates to all apps (there is bug in DownloadManager that causes app update downloads to hang at progress up to 100%). In addition, using this app stops push notifications of other apps such as WhatsApp, Gmail, MyEnv etc.... that are running in the background. I open WhatsApp to find dozens of new messages when I am running TraceTogether. This behaviour has been observed on both my wife's and my phones.	2

19801	I know this is the first release and it looks really well. Down the line I would like to see number of active cases and active cases broke down by county. Also, have live daily updates i.e. how many news cases, deaths etc. Narrow down areas where there are clusters. Hopefully you will gather some useful data and trends. Best of luck with the app.	0

19807	App almost unusable anymore. Since one week, the app consumption has gone from 2-3% to around 30% of the battery, leading to an early shutdown of the device which therefore isn't tracing anymore. And if we want to save the battery then we have to stop the app which, of course, stop the tracing either. Early user of this app, I'm really convinced of its value, so it's really sad that developers have made a version which will have a negative impact on the contact tracing overall. EDIT : @Government Technology Agency : I had reached out to your support center before, but as per your comment, I've just sent an email to your services with all detailed infos.	1
19808	It may have been me, I didn't understand how it worked.	1
19809	Found to be very useful	1
19810	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0

I managed to stop the loop by deactivating Bluetooth which causes an error in the app. Tried some troubleshooting just to be sure then everything was fixed when I uninstalled the app. I'm on Google Pixel 3. Please fix	2

19834	The idea deserves praise. It would be good, though, if the app gave some kind of indication (if you ask for it) that it's working/doing anything at all. For example show how many other devices it has communicated with. So that you get a feeling that it's actually working.	0

19848	Hi, in the last 30 hours my Samsung A5 keeps reporting that Covid App is hogging CPU and phone needs to be restarted. Indeed a full battery charge is drained in a few hours and phone is very hot to touch. I checked online, did a few things like cleaning Google play service cache etc. Even Unistalled Play service updates but still the same. In the end I had to uninstall Covid App which is NOT something I want to do. You guys wrote this App. You need to investigate and revert clear message.	1

19850	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

19854	This app has had issues in Oppo AX5S. Randomly decides to shut down due to battery optimisation on phone. This has been disabled yet still does it. Had not had any issues with galaxy s7. Please resolve this or make people VERY AWARE that it can happen, otherwise what's the point?	1

19862	Easy to use and dose not collect much data. Also light on battery. If you use Facebook you have no excuse not to use this app. It should be mandatory. So we all could comeback to at least something similar to normal life.	0

19870	The exposure check on this app cannot be functioning correctly. It said that it performed checks on 17 keys at a time when I was in the house with no one else around or within a couple hundred metres of the house. This doesn't fill me with confidence in the accuracy of these checks.	1

19895	Extremely disappointed. More than 3 months since my initial feedback that the QR code scanning does not work on the Redmi 10x Pro phone and it remained unfixed after 3 new releases since then. All other QR code scanners work on this phone except the TraceTogether App. The developers just could not be bothered to fix this.	2

19901	Superb	0
19902	Good move to add the QR scanner BUT it doesnt have the Check Out option. So i have to fall back to the existing QR Scanner from Trend Micro.	2
19903	This latest iteration tells you how many people you have been in contact with. I tested it. Yesterday during my exercise the number of contacts increased by 14. I had walked continuous for 45 minutes, did not need to stop to cross road. I walk behind one person, until I was able to overtake. I did pass several people sitting at bus stops. We were told that contacts would be recorded based on within 2 metres for 1 minute. From my test, it would appear the time element is not working.	2
19904	My system UI crashed no less than 7 times just trying to get the app set up. And then I'm expected to trust that everyone actually has this app installed, and everyone is always carrying their phone on their bodies, and everyone always has their Bluetooth on, and everyone has immediately marked themselves as tested positive on this app (because apparently the qr doesn't work anyway)? Seems more than a bit farfetched to me. This app is only giving people a false sense of security in my opinion..	2

19950	System is displaying my name and Emirates ID number correctly but is asking me to logout saying that login with another number but the number displayed is not the registered one.	2
19951	The app is really useful. % of cases per county population would be a useful number to have. Also, a push notification to check in daily would be good too.	0

19960	The app drain my phone battery. There is no off bluetooth function on the app. I am using a smartwatch which is linked to my phone. If I off the phone bluetooth, I can't use my watch optimally. Please do your logistics proper before rolling your nonsense out. If you can't do a proper app then do not roll it out. If you can't have enough tokens, stop making Trace Together compulsory. Seriously dumb!	1
19961	Seems to function in the background so long as I keep my Bluetooth turned on with the only intrusiveness being a persistent notification bar icon.	2
19962	Does not show if anyone nearby has been tested positive or been in contact with a positive case. It would work better if linked with phone number & UAE ID for those who do not sign up. It will be more efficient.	0

19981	Not good at all.. drains battery too fast.. Errors every other day when I open the app.. uninstalled and reinstalled many times and activated but still same.. every second day it crashes.. at the moment doesn't even load when I open it.. just a blank screen.. Don't know what to do.. I left trying..	1
19982	Excellent	0
19983	Useless	1
19984	Great engineering effort; has been analysed by independent Android engineers as transparent and secure. It is however a complete and comprehensive failure of public service politics as the app appears to not be in use at all in epidemic tracing. The mind just boggles.	1
19985	Awesome app	0
19986	Didn't like the old version as I had lots of issues like causing the GMail app to stop syncing. Let alone the annoying permanent notification on the screen. But the new version overcome 90% of the issues. Well done Aussies!	1

19997	Good App regarding the usage for contact tracing for the current Pandemic. Suggestion: options like SafeEntry/Exit QR-Code Scan, ID BarCode and list of Visited Places is not available for non-locals. Perhaps you may want to add this feature to all users of TraceTogether. Keep up the good work, Team. Stay Healthy and Stay Safe.	0

20005	Very good app and very essential but for last few days, this app is killing my battery and phone identifies this as the cause, didn't happen before then and I've made no changes. Can somebody have a look pls as I want to keep this but not if it drains my battery.	1
20006	Nice application	0
20007	Overheat my phone damaging my battery on Note 10+	1
20008	Both me and several others I know cannot use the app any longer because after a few days of successful use it has started incorrectly reporting the user name and password is wrong. This cannot be fixed by using the “forgot password” functionality, as after resetting it still gives the same error. So basically this issue renders the app unusable and is, I guess, affecting a lot of users.	1
20009	Very good app	0
20010	When we change to new phone the app seems to remember the ip address of old phone. It do not allow uis to install the tracetogether in my new phone when we transfer the sum card to new phone. But.... On the old phone we can uninstall and reinstall to the old phone only. The OTP will not deliver if we try to install to new phone.	2

20021	Dropping to 4 as serious battery drain on version 1.0.1.44 recently. May be related to July 2020 Android 9 update which installed last week. Simple, streamlined and effective. I hope to never get the alert though.	1
20022	Awesome app for the safety of nation. Great idea to create this app to trace those who might be affected with Covid. This will definitely saves life. Cool stuff.	0
20023	Such an easy sign up process, app is very straight forward to use and the amount of personal information being captured is negligible. People really need to understand the facts and give this a go before playing the usual anti government card.	0

20026	Good for everyone	0
20027	Good	0
20028	The latest versions are good. The Bluetooth technology can reach much further - 100m or more depending on version? Which explains why popular places, though the spot around u is not crowded, would quickly rake up Bluetooth exchanges into 10s and 100s quickly. The count would seem misleading. If MOH can subsequently filter data based on signal strength, wouldn't better to NOT exchange and record other users that are physically not nearby in first place?	1
20029	The idea and goal is good. The design is poor. Why would you need Phone and Storage access? The UI could improve, why would you give a splash screen with the start button? Why don't you just go straight to the main screen? Last, when you post updates, please be more transparent and give more details about the update. Don't just mention "minor bug fixes". Thanks.	0
20030	This app does not let me set up a new account because it is not letting me enter the nationality. There is no drop down menu that pops up when you click on the nationality tab. I have tried reinstalling the app but the same thing happens.	2

20035	Covid tracing apps should be very low on battery use. I have used and tested multipe national apps, and the French tous anti covid is the single app that drains the battery, making it very undesirable for average public to use. Seconds critique is that it needs manual activation. Most other apps automatically activate once Bluetooth is on. Why force the user to open the app and activate? I like the statistics page and useful links.	1

20147	My app keeps turning itself off due to battery optimisation. All my phone settings are fine but still keeps turning off each time I reset.	1
20148	After updating to the latest version (red app icon) the following functions totally crashes the app: The barcode icon on top right and the SafeEntry. Once you clicked on either of this the app will just crash and exit itself.	2
20149	Very problem	1
20150	Great sales lady \ud83d\ude1c	2
20151	Worst app..continuous battery drainage...bluetooth usage..and high battery usage...	1
20152	So when exceeded number of activation, then after how long we suppose to wait and activate again? The app isn't working proper. And call center they have no any help.	2
20153	Consuming way too much battery	1
20154	VERY GOOD	0
20155	Easy to install.... feeling safe thank you Gov	0
20156	Everytime I try to sign into the app it says that it is "Temporarily unavailable" and that "We're really sorry. Please try again later." I have tried many times and yet the same thing shows up.	2
20157	So far it works - but you should offer a TL;DR version of the mandatory introduction (the part of "how the app works", which is very clear for technically inclined people, but could deter some by its length and technicality)	0
20158	Nice app	0
20159	Great App	0
20160	Works great if people who were exposed to covid 19 also have the app, if they don't have it or don't own a smartphone or leave their phone in the car or at home etc then it's obviously useless, they could be sitting beside you and you wouldn't know it. Best to just do the 2m thing and wear our masks	0
20161	Works fine we all need to get this app	0
20162	Useful for everyone.	0
20163	good	0
20164	Unable to proceed with the error message: Too many request. * I appreciate the team's prompt reply and fixing the issue.	2

20166	Very bad ðŸ‘Ž	1
20167	I don’t see people who have had Covid-19 putting this app on their phone.\nIf they had corona virus and they are no longer infected, what good will this app do?\nI honestly don’t see this working at all	1
20168	As far as using it is concerned, a good app. I didn't leave CH during this time so I never experienced unwanted "Turn bluetooth back on" messages. However... I tested positive more than 24 hours ago and have still not got any means of entering this into the app. Helpline cannot help either. Is this not the point of the app? Speed? How about having patients sign a form at the test center allowing the laboratory to enter the status locally? You don't need to be a Swiss engineer to implement this!	0
20169	Best app for every one	0
20170	Installed easily. No impact on my phone. :-)	0
20171	For an app that's meant to help protect the community its poorly designed and filled with glitches. After installing it on my s20 I couldn't open any apps without them crashing and my battery drains way too quickly. I ended up uninstalling the app. You would think they would put better design into an app like this. Why do we also need Bluetooth on? Seems silly	1
20172	It doesn't work . Not open	2
20173	After so much hype about this app it\u2019s disappointing that it won\u2019t accept my phone number. Tried with zeroes and without zeroes, just get an error message!	2
20174	Best app for this situation	0
20175	After I contacted the support team they helped me to use this app so I will give this a 4/5 since we still need to use Bluetooth which might decrease some people phones	0
20176	App doesn't work on my Oppo phone with Android 5.1. Phone can't upgrade to higher version of Android. Govtech should ensure new version of app is backward compatible. Not many people can afford new phone	2
20177	App serves its purpose, but UI/UX is poor. “New check in” and “check out” buttons are the same color and so close together. Resulting in easy accidental check out when multiple check ins are required. Basic UX principle of differentiation.	0
20178	Not working !	2
20179	Excellent apps	0
20180	The app will not accept my mobile number	2

20215	This app is dangerous. We need better data. The data it is too vague and out dated so as a result it causes a serious amount of complacency. I advise anyone getting this app to put the bluetooth feature on and set it and forget it.	1
20216	Not working	1
20217	If this is the official government app for COVID, it should work with the exposure notifications in Android. It does not even have the covid app badge. For reference, check apps like Immuni (Italy's official covid app which works with android's built in exposure notification settings)	2

20233	I don't understand it. How does it work, it doesn't favor everyone in their class. Only for rich citizens.	1
20234	I can't scan QR code after update	2
20235	Beware! Using this app prevents Google Play Store from downloading updates to all apps (there is bug in DownloadManager that causes app update downloads to hang at progress up to 100%). In addition, using this app stops push notifications of other apps such as WhatsApp, Gmail, MyEnv etc.... that are running in the background. I open WhatsApp to find dozens of new messages when I am running TraceTogether. This behaviour has been observed on both my wife's and my phones.	2

20251	It says no location tracking is required in news, but how come location permission is required?	2
20252	Pointless having installed, turns inactive after a short period of time, tells you to activate battery optimizer then tells you that you cannot use the app with it on even though it warns it uses a lot of battery to run in the background. Please fix this app to be more effective if it turns off after a short period of time how are we meant to remain aware of any local covid cases we may have come into contact with	1
20253	It’s simple and easy to use. There’s no bug and I like how fast this was created for the benefit of our safety. However it would be great if it could work on the background. I constantly forgot to switch the app on when I’m out with others or to work. And when travelling it can be boring for me as I took 1.5 hour to travel to work. But other then that, I try my best to switch it on when I’m out.	0
20254	This app is terrible. It shows that some of your contacts are high risk, but won't tell you which one. How you are supposed to avoid them if you don't know how they are?	1

20280	It is a good app. My phone did not slow down its perfonmance. I will trust the goverment on this. If they fail us they will certainly pay. The app needs a "turn off" button as I don't need it running in the background when stayin at home.	0

20293	This app is exceptionally hard on battery usage. I currently have to fully recharge my phone twice a day!!	1
20294	It's a good app. But this is my second time reinstalling it. And the reason why I uninstalled the first time was because of its battery consumption. My phone went from 100 to 10% within 4 hrs.. Is there anyway that the app can be more energy efficient? By the way, I'm using an old phone. Samsung S9. Imagine people using the older phone. Their phone will be drained even faster. I strongly believe this is one of the main reasons why the take-up rate by public is so low.	1

20338	Dowloading was smooth, I was hoping to see my results , i was tested in April and had received my results...the app say i have no results. I was hoping to see if anybody near me has positive through the app. I though that was the whole purpose of the app to know it. To keep know whether to stay away from specific location. Kind of disappointed so far. Hopefully there is an update and this app is of some use.	1
20339	1. Access to privacy 2.Not work on Older OS versions 3.Only register who has RP with QID, then what about those who are in Bussines work visa or Visit visas? If the registeration also possible with passport also makes it good.	1

20373	Since that update fixed the battery usage it's been fine. And now with most recent update, the UI looks more clean and has more information added. Will be using this until it's not necessary, probably until late next year.	0
20374	So far so good	0
20375	Hi, my company requires this application, but the Safe Entry function is not making itself available. Deleted and re-registered three times already. Still does not work. Please do something about this. I'm using an Oppo R9 Plus.	2
20376	However, this app hangs once in awhile when registering	2
20377	When I updated not working at all. Got stuck pl do the heedful	2
20378	force close	2
20379	App not working many times downloaded	2

20382	Pretty good so far ... simple, clear and not intrusive. Would prefer an Android Adaptive icon though.	0
20383	Cant even get past mobile number on registration.	2
20384	Will not accept my mobile number, cannot sign up for app	2
20385	Realtime results are no where near accurate.	1
20386	When I updated the app then this is not working what can I do	2
20387	Excellent apps	0
20388	Poor	1
20389	Even after negative report co.es the app doest update the status whoch is such a deterrent.	1
20390	There should be an option to exit this app, when at home. It consumes battery unnecessarily, when the Bluetooth and location is turned off. You should understand there are people out there who do not enable location and Bluetooth unnecessarily, when not in use. I have to stop this app everytime when at home.	2
20391	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0
20392	Useless ! It shows only the LOGO...no information, no statistics..no places ...NOTHING.	1
20393	Turn off Wi-Fi while registering, this gets round invalid number issue	2

20400	Really good initiative. I think it has more potential to grow as per the comments but mostly we should try and appreciate SOMETHING the govt does rather than critisizing every move they make. May Allah protect all of us Pakistanis and the rest of the world from this pandemic , in sha Allah , Ameen.	0
20401	It very bad on the battery for my phone, even my phone is a 2 year phone but it manage to last one day of usage. But with this app it just drain my battery so badly that I need to off my bluetooth or stop the app from running. Battery percentage was 49% and without doing anything within 45min the battery percentage drop to 39%. How to use sia.	1
20402	Wont let me add phone number	2
20403	No battery drain on android. Easy to use. Hopefully it does what it says on the tin.	1
20404	its Great	0
20405	I am happy to contribute to society by using the application. It works well on my phone. The only issue I have is that if you push updates the developer should provide a decent change log. It creates trust in an environment where a lot of people feel there is potential for miss use of data.	0
20406	I have installed before, but occassionally everytime I'm experiencing problem. my bluetooth device such wireless headphones & wearable always disconnected when at crowded user.at the end, i try reinstall, but it won't let me remove from my phone to try fix it. My solution, Phone factory reset. I'm so frustrated about this.please fix the issue.	2
20407	Useless. I downloaded this app from the time they adviced to download this. I live in Melbourne and working in a covid ward in a public hospital but this app never notify me if I am closeby to any covid positive cases. Well I am definitely like less than 1m with covid positive patients many times. It means this app is not working at all.	2
20408	Very useful app \ud83d\udc4d	0
20409	Battery usage very very high	1
20410	Very nice	0
20411	Is it possible to make it available on HUAWEI App Gallery too? Using P40 Pro.	2
20412	Great idea but if a person with confirmed covid19 should be self isolating by law so will they have the app and take it out and about with them	0
20413	Had no troubles, works ok from day1 of release. Now i find out the phone app had battery optimization enabled which prevents app from running correctly. Uninstalled + reloaded as i thought app was the issue. Then used PC and Google to locate how to ensure no optimization on the app. I only turn bluetooth on when i leave home. So no battery issues.	1

20435	Our Bluetooth can start automatically every time we restart our mobile. It seems that this app needs to be manually started. It's hard to remember to do this. Can it be made to auto restart too?	2
20436	I'm sad. I saw that my friend using iPhone has a widget, but we don't have it on android phones. Also, the splash screen which displays for a few seconds each time we open the app makes starting the app and use the features longer than it could be. No wonder, there's always people stuck at the barcode waiting for the app to load.	2

20481	This destroyed my battery, most days I'd start on 80% and finish on around 20% with moderate use, after downloading this app I don't even make it a few hours into the day without needing to charge, stuff like this shouldn't be happening with a 4,000 Mah battery.	1

20517	I keep COVID Alert running in the background (not sure if I have to) and there’s no battery drain I can see from it. I love that it’s private and uses random changing number strings to ping other phones. It’s a simple app that says yes or no you’ve been exposed. Everyone who can should download it! The more who do, the better we’ll get control of COVID-19. We’re all in this together!	0
20518	After update the aap has stop working Not onle me my friends also updated Same problem	2
20519	It's important people use it. It's safe and works good. You have all the current key info about the Covid at hand. Also you are informed about next steps as soon as possible if there was a risk you got infected. So you can immediately stop spreading virus further, doing your part saving lives, health and easing the weight put on med staff. It's a huge help with minimum effort. It does have a meaning. Any extra time we help to gain for the continuing intense worldwide research is worth a lot.	0

20562	COVID-19 has nearly been around for a year now and the app is still not able to be used in all provinces. If reporting is not able to be done in the app in all provinces, why use “Canada” in the app name? More importantly, why have it on our phones if it’s proprietary to only certain provincial needs?	1
20563	There always appears red question mark. I already called the hotline but no progress at all.	2
20564	Just install it.	2
20565	Unable to install again...had uninstalled as it was not functioning... please help...for registration the phone number is not submitted.	2
20566	Sorry as much as I think the initiative is good, this app just drained my battery, and the constant notification that can't be cleared or hidden got annoying after only a few hours. Uninstalled!	1

20569	Can't get the app to work after first time use. Can't get anyone on helpline 109 either. Tried on 3 different phones. Tried both my numbers on 3 phones one at a time.

20571	Echoing comments on interfering with other Bluetooth devices. Wireless earphones are continually connecting/disconnecting due to the app tabulating the Bluetooth interactions it has.

20575	Had the app installed since early July. In the last week my new phone was being drained with battery power and would have to charge it twice a day. Along with that the screen would heat up, this really annoyed me so I got rid of the app off my phone and immediately the battery power improved. I will not use this app again until I know for certain that it will not harm my phone and that the proof is shown that these major problems have been resolved completely.	1
20576	Before you complain about why the app needs location services enabled, read the pdf on how the app works on the BAG website. An please for the love of god stop crying.	0

20580	Not working	1
20581	Due to its automatic activation of bluetooth and GPS, I have to keep my phone charged most of the time, and the notification also cannot be turned off, which keeps my phone beeping...is there anyway to fix at least about notification? Is it only with my phone??	1

20632	Keeping the Bluetooth on from morning to evening drastically affected the battery and with every update its unpredictable.

20641	Why this app to manage my phone calls ?	1
20642	No problems, very useful app.	0
20643	This App Confusion my mind..??????	0
20644	Since I installed this app, my battery drains in less than 7 hours!	1
20645	Good	0
20646	I would score this higher however, my Wife, who has had the same phone number for 13 years, cannot download the app as her "phone number is not valid". Come on app designers, sort this out. You would get a much higher take up rate if everyone could access it!	2
20647	I cant upload my Fin number....its always says invalid, so cant proceed to next	2

20651	When I put in my phone number it says "Please try again later"	2
20652	As a developer myself I looked into the security concerns and I was satisified with what I saw. I read the reviews of people describing how it screwed up their Bluetooth connectivity but i thought I'd give it a try anyway hoping that might not happen for me. Well, it stopped my watch from connecting to my phone and it started interfering when my phone was connected to the car. So after 2 days I've given up. I will happily reinstall it once they can fix these issues but not until then	1
20653	Battery quickly discharged	1

20671	Please enable 2FA SMS for dual SIM phones. I'm not receiving the SMS verification by SMS. there seem to be a few direct communications engines that will not send to dual SIM phones despite the number being verified being a Singapore number. Would be great if SG tech team could fix this. TIA. Thank you. It worked when I tried again. Probably my "user error". \ud83d\ude44 Fantastic initiative. Keep up.the good work! #SGUnited	2
20672	Nice	0
20673	Good intentions but the given reason it wants Location Permissions is not true - as far back as June 2019 Google has already told developers you can use the CompanionDeviceManager to perform a (Bluetooth) scan of nearby companion devices on behalf of your app without requiring the location permission.	2

20678	Just, useless. Wanted to do my part in the pandemic, this app appears to be useless in actually tracing anything. No info on its efficacy and it hasn't prevented a single case so there really is no point to this app.	2
20679	I'm really thankful to the ministry of interior to provide such a unique application to fullfil my daily needs under COVID-19 atmosphere. Hats off to the government of KSA.	0

Devs are responsive, currently app doesn't cross-check *previous* 14 day GPS - only starts collecting history from time of download but developers seem to be working on it.

20689	Dear people, this is Govt owned app. No one will bother to listen your comments regarding malfunctioning of app.	1
20690	Works fine, alot of people are having trouble with "Invalid Phone Number", I had this problem, and closing and reopening the app and re-entering it.	0
20691	This application. Is cannot. Send OTP code. How to do.	2
20692	So far it works - but you should offer a TL;DR version of the mandatory introduction (the part of "how the app works", which is very clear for technically inclined people, but could deter some by its length and technicality)	0
20693	Good job	0
20694	Unable to sign up on this app. Cannot complete filling date.	2
20695	From 5  to 1 Coronalert BE app is *no longer compatible  with (e.g.!) Sony Xperia running Android 9... Is it a new policy to *decrease* the adoption of and support for the Coronalert BE app?	2
20696	I keep my bluetooth running all day for this app, it has hardly affected my battery life. My phone still lasts the whole day.	0
20697	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
20698	Downloaded the app, entered my email okay but after, trying to enter the 6 digit code and the personal details (first, last, phone) failed to activate the keyboard. Had to copy paste into those boxes.	1
20699	Very bad app I'm crazy every time not open this app how to open	1
20700	Good	0
20701	The pause function is good if we can customize/set the pause duration to save battery life while we at home. Please also work on making the app workable for Huawei phones without Google services.	2
20702	serious Bluetooth issues, constantly cuts off my music and replaces it with a buzzing sound. uninstalling this app fixed the issue.	2
20703	My phone was scorching, i almost went to buy a new phone as my battery was going from 100% to 15% within 2 hours, it was almost too hot to handle at times.. but i seen that this app was actually the issue, i uninstalled it & now my phone is perfect	1

20707	Fantastic App!Stay Safe	0
20708	Got completely logged out & had to enter user & password. Whether this is due to update in app I don’t know but could lead to people pretending to scan the Covid posters.  I entered visits manually, but busy people might give up, or simply have no time! Apart from that the iPhone app works well.	1
20709	Can the app be updated with a sort of a reminder for people to check in everyday? It would be great to have it, you can see that the numbers of people who is checking in has decreased on the app.	1
20710	Liked the App. Good job done on it and looks very effective but I am sad to say that the fact it uses Bluetooth it drained 10% out of my Battery in just 2 minutes. So sorry but I have just uninstalled the App. If mobile data gets utilised for it in the future I will definitely reinstall and use then once I know my battery will not drain away.	0
20711	I believe that in this app should be included actual governmental restrictions and requirements.	2
20712	Useless app.	1
20713	Awesome aap in Kuwait	0
20714	The app is consuming a huge chunk of battery usage around 25-35% which drains the battery really fast. What's worst is that despite having the app turned on, it's not giving out any notification of nearby Covid-19 patients on my Samsung S9+. Just yesterday my aunt's Note 5 stopped working due to battery drainage by this app. You'll have to do something about this app and make it more stable and not cause devices to corrupt.	1
20715	If your notifications aren't showing properly, go to Settings->Notifications->COVIDSafe and toggle off "Foreground Service". This will disable the "currently active" notification, but the app will continue running as intended. Devs should really fix this though; there's people who will uninstall the app because of this.	1
20716	Good	0
20717	Had the app since mid July and it suddenly started draining the battery of my S20 yesterday. This seems to be happening to a lot of people all of a sudden. Needs to be fixed or everyone is going to remove the app from their phones	1
20718	App was going great then suddenly it says it's inactive and I need to turn Bluetooth on. The app gets as far as "turning on Bluetooth" and nothing...I uninstalled then reinstalled but the same thing happens. Sorry PM. Want to do my part to help but this app is just doesn't work. \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude26	2

20725	It's good	0
20726	Bit of a power drainer, when at home, switch off Bluetooth and location, icons and settings. But like buying masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, we can all help to beat Coronavirus.	1

20735	Battery drain; past couple of days App eating battery. Phone drained from 100 to zero % in about 10 hours. Normally get 1.5 - 2 days from battery. Unfortunately will have to uninstall.	1
20736	i can't register in to the app it keep telling me something went wrong try again later	2
20737	Had to reset my phone and reinstall the app. Now when I try to open it after agreeing to the t's&c's I get "Error code: (1003). Please try again" .	1
20738	Don’t developers realise married couples often share the same email address? This app will only allow one account per email. We often go to visit different places which makes the app useless in those circumstances!!!	1
20739	It's keep crashing everytime I try to upload the rapid test results and I don't know why	1

20749	Simple installation. Those who got the invalid phone number message (like I did) were trying to register before 6pm. Worked fine after that. This app makes sense and will help to protect me, my family, the community and our health workers, as well as speeding up our return to normal life.	2
20750	Very bad	1

20787	Why App required to manage our call details and access to Photo and Gallery? This option should be removed. Feature to be added to turn ON App only when going out or any visitor coming at home. It will protect battery to get drain.	1
20788	I think this app was made by an indian . The worst part is with its flaws . Drains more battery , the bluetooth is always on whenever o switch it on . It' s the worst survaillance app .	1
20789	Nice	0
20790	I proud of you for mode in India , so, make it large ðŸ‘�ðŸ‘�	0
20791	Why do you need access to media files? How is this even legal? Also, keeps crashing all the time and drains battery while heating up the phone. The authorities have done a great job with this initiative and I am all in for this app, however the developers must work out on bugs and ensure privacy of users. This is not a time to corner the public and oblige them to compromise on allowing access to sensitive data!	1
20792	Recently started to require all sorts of additional information (and phone permissions), with no good reason why stated. Includes full name, DOB, NRIC, etc. Defeats the initial intention and purpose of "lightweight"/"minimum info" tracing. Feels like full blown surveillance. Uninstalled for that reason. Such a shame.	2
20793	Not receiving any otp. Tried both my Globe and Smart, still not receiving one.	2
20794	Thanks Ya Qatar for Good treatment with Number one class facility	0
20795	Last version was good . Kindly add statistics button as mention in last version. Why there was need for new update . Thanks	2
20796	v nice	0
20797	The app puts a fixed SAFE bar at bottom of screen. The bar obstructs usage of other apps.. Eg. NEXT or OK button... Though I think it is an important app but I had to uninstall.	2
20798	Sspy	1
20799	App has no issues on my phone, and working in the background, despite what some people believe (battery draining is the main one), my phone has not drop its charge that was noticeable by me. In order for it to work effectively, more people needs to download it. It is not working as it should because people are too worried about 'privacy'. The app is 'contact traCING', not 'personal information traCKING'. Don't blame the app for not working, look at the people that don't have it.	1
20800	It's okay	0
20801	A good attempt to give awareness and help on the part of the government.	0

20809	great initiative to help each other with this app, however disagree with the idea of putting the phone face down whereby the phone is the most dirty. yes i understand, it is one of the ways to save battery on iPhone as it closes/dims the phone screen. hmm... i hope developers can assist or find another way to keep this running in the background without users putting phones facing it down on tables or surfaces. a big thank you for all the efforts!	0
20810	A very nicely made, minimalist app, that only uses as much information as is required. Only requires the use of Bluetooth to keep track of other devices you've been in close contact with throughout your day, and notifies you if the user of one of those devices contracts symptoms.	0
20811	very nice	0
20812	App works great ! How about allowing the user to record temperature within the app and allowing express entry without temperature checks if it has already been recorded. This will encourage more people to check their own temperatures and also allow quicker entry into places where there’s usually a queue to check temperature e.g at mall entrances. Thanks !!	0
20813	Good app to check if I have infection chances or not.	0
20814	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
20815	Have been trying to get the verification code however not receiving it	2
20816	10 characters, digit, capital letter - lost interest, deleted it....\nFollow up - thanks for your developer follow up comments quoting the NZ GSB (Government Security Bureau) standards, but 10 digits is over the top, even by Apples standards. The app uptake is evident of this. Overkill with basic security requirement.	1
20817	super easy setup process, after which it's pretty much "set it and forget it". No excessive permissions required. Doesn't seem to affect my battery life much.	0
20818	I tried to register today with my EID & mobile ( the one that I used in COVID test). After getting the OTP it shows "Wrong Credentials". It says to log in different mobile number. Please let me know what I need to do to successfully log in.	1

20820	It's not useful at all because it's not working. Actually i wasted my time for downloading it	1

20822	It's a good app. But what's the guarantee that people always carry their phone around? Ineffective till the entire population has this app installed, including migrant workers. People who are commenting that there's no affect on battery life, please observe carefully.	0
20823	Great to have this on my device given the alarming cases worldwide. Better safe than sorry.	0
20824	I have been having the problem with app from last 1 month everytime i open the app i have to login again but this time when i tried to login the pin code that they gave i put exactly that but it showed error that it is not verified and later on said to contact 109 as the number of tries have been exceeded	2
20825	I don't know whats the use of this app	1
20826	I kept waiting for one time code during login, tried multiple times, no message ever.	2
20827	I am a healthcare worker who stays out of my accomodation for more than 12 hours a day.The app doesnt allow to add exemptions which might give a wrong alert.	1

20829	Good	0
20830	Feeling positive thats all just give it a TRY.....ðŸ™�	0
20831	Bad experience, battery draining isn't the only problem with this app. Due to constant exchanges it causes all my bluetooth device to randomly disconnect frequently. Initially thought my devices were broken, but no, it's all due to this app. Have even tried different OS build + kernels but as long as I uninstall this app, the issue resolves itself. Won't be using this until the bluetooth disconnection issue is solved. Would not recommend others to use this unless no physical token.	1
20832	Suspicious!	1
20833	The application does not work	2
20834	Doesn't work probably	1
20835	Can't use it because I'm in the US.	2
20836	Stuck at filling in our IC particulars. Always have error. Despite filling all details according to IC. Still telling us verification failed. Check all field. You should check on your end. If still having bug and not ready, dont force people to use this app.	2
20837	ok	0

20839	Easy to set up	2
20840	Good thinking. It might be help	0
20841	Asks for GPS location. I uninstalled this app because it kept asking me to enable Google location services, therefore accessing my GPS location. This is in stark contrast to what was claimed.	2
20842	Not working \u2639\ufe0f..	2
20843	can not trust this app. My neighbours (2 people) has tested positive and it shows zero case in 1 km radius. They are at home isolation.	1
20844	eating up the battery \ud83d\ude2d, and we need explanation why it asks for storage permission?	1
20845	I have tried to sign up but it says my mobile number is invalid I have tried multiple ways of putting it in but nothing has worked. Ughhhh	2
20846	I had installed this app. But i do have one doubt. Why do you need access to our media files and storage? i didn't get the logic for storage permission.?	1
20847	Too good a friend of human being .	0
20848	Stop using this app to protect your personal information from getting into wrong hands. There's no legal binding that forces users to install this App. Furthermore, for pacemaker patients in particular having multiple bluetooth devices in close proximity is a health risk.	1
20849	Seems to be ok. Would love to see daily numbers (not graph - the y axis is too big to see detail).	0
20850	Please allow auto-rotation of screen or scaling of page or fonts. I can't see the full message on my phone. After restarting the application it was fixed. It decided today, after update, that I was somewhere with a Corona patient but I wasn't there at all. My mother got the same notice and she never even left the house. It has to improve. People's life are decided by it.	1
20851	Killing my battery in the last 2 days if this keeps up I'll have to uninstall it 3 times yesterday i had to recharge my battery where as it would normally last nearly a full day.	1
20852	To people feeling "suspicious" or "complaining", that they use public transport and still didn't get the notification - are you *hoping* to get infected? Just a reminder, that to get that notification you need to 1) be less than 1,5 meter away from the infected person 2) the contact must last 15 minutes 3) the person must have the app installed as well. All in all, it's not that likely now, but the app still works and is useful. Let's hope everybody installs it and to never get the notification.	2
20853	The app keeps crashing !!! I have been experiencing this problem for more than 30 days. I have been installing every update that comes through but still the app doesn't work.	1

20859	App is useful for contact tracing. However, why do you not allow group check in yet make the function available. Please make this available when you are bringing babies to the polyclinic yet you need physical ID to scan in. This is increasing touch point which is defeats the original idea of reducing touch point	2
20860	Imagine forcing us to keep bluetooth on.. AND FORCED PUSH NOTIFICATION WOW	2

20878	Presumably working quietly in the background. Pleasing that the source code has been made available. A persistent, slightly irritating and presumptuous "keeping you safe" badge cannot be easily hidden but at least will remind me to delete the app when/if the need is passed.	1
20879	Not able to set location.	2
20880	This is draining battery because it's tracking more than covid symptoms. Its reading everything in your phone. Spyware.	1
20881	Hopefully useful but only if more people use it correctly. You must keep your Bluetooth on for it to track and trace other phones.	0
20882	I am not able to add the Emirates Id, and the system gives error .	1
20883	Easy to understand. It is a very thoughtful way of contact tracing. I hope with this tool, people will be more conscious of their actions especially those that spit n throw their use tissues on the dinner table at Food court become more careful with their act.	0
20884	This is a great idea	0
20885	Not compatible with Huawei P40 Pro. Blocked on mobile number registration (when click on "get OTP" nothing happen)	2
20886	Great idea in principle but unfortunately of little practical benefit as not every shop or location has a QR code. First time using the app and out of the 5 places I went to yesterday, only one had a QR code. I ended up recording everything in my notepad, but that doesn’t have the advantage of linking in to the contact tracing of the app.\n\nAn easy fix would be to include an ‘add it manually’ option. Search the business or location by address (using address autocomplete that is already active in the app in the personal details section). Include a manual override if the autocomplete doesn’t quite fit. Then a screen to select date and time in time out. It could even be done live with a button to press on entry and exit.\nAlternatively for even easier input, allow location services to locate address, click to confirm, then have the entry and exit buttons to stamp date/time.\n\nAs it stands, it is of very limited use and will only be able to trace a tiny percentage of crowd activity. I buy into the idea and would love to see a more inclusive app... because I want to be contacted if I have been to a place at risk!	1
20887	Poor performance. Only Finnish as an language option. Forces you to use GPS for tracking. Uses in part Google's closed code. Uninstalled as unsable.	1
20888	Great app	0
20889	While I understand the possible need to scan the QR code the first we are at the location (as opposed to finding it on a list like the Singpass app - Safe Entry), one handy feature that is missing from the Trace Together app that would be good to have is having your favorites show up based on your location rather than showing the full list (reference how Singpass app- Safe Entry handles their favourites)	2
20890	Why does it say that my number is invalid? Edit: Everything works well after the update, as promised. Great to see the fast response! Really proud to be in Singapore!	2

20897	Battery drain issues appear to be fixed, but I'm afraid the damage has already been done... Having it drain a full battery in a few hours flat is a great way to have the entire country delete the app and wipe out all progress in a matter of days. Good job, guys. Really hope this doesn't happen again...	1
20898	It's an important app. But is only useful if your phone doesn't run out of battery. I normally finish the day on 65%. I've had to plug by phone in to charge during the day. I'm now at 12% after a 25% top up charge. This thing eats batteries for breakfast. Uninstalling.	0

20907	Not so effective ey!	1
20908	Before has problem I gave 5star, but now I give 3star. After update, shows notification: to close this app. Then I can not open this app. Please fix it.	1
20909	An absolutely useless app that doesn\u2019t work unless you walk around with your phone unlocked and the app open. Counting download rates doesn\u2019t count the apps effectiveness.	1

20937	I noticed that since I've been using the App, my music on my wireless headphones has got intermittent lags. Especially when I'm in the gym or shopping centre. I can confirm this but I think it's whenever the app logs a contact, the music lags. If I played it through the physical earphones there's no problem. So I'm guessing the Bluetooth connection has got something to do with it.	2

20939	Not able to change mobile phone. Please add this option with OTP confirmation. Thank you.	2
20940	Downloaded, installed and turned on notifications no problem - very easy. Yes, it does automatically turn on your Bluetooth which drains the battery faster but I'm keeping it on only when I'm outside my house&work, e.g.shopping.	0

20944	I want to use this app but it's killing my battery as a large number of people have said. I've left it installed and just enable it and disable it as required via permissions so I can still use my phone. Kind of defeats the purpose but what can you do.	1
20945	Does not use my battery lesser by turning off bluetooth when i at home. Also, not able to use my bluetooth head phones when app using it for tracking, have to manually turn off bluetooth	1

20955	Update: Installed latest ver. Same issue. Uninstalled. Original: I've downloaded this app a few times but hv deleted it in frustration. I don't think I've deleted an app so many times b4. Other users hv mentioned abt Bluetooth connection w rgd 2 connecting to BT speakers, in my case, in the car. The music keeps stopping intermittently and once I've deleted the app, it is completely fine. Until this matter is resolved, I am looking forward to collecting my token once my cc announces e launch.	2

20975	Well done HSC, the cooperation on the island to get a Northern Ireland Covid tracker app up and running has been fantastic work, and the interoperability of the underlying platforms both here and across Europe is a great move. The app willconnect to the Google Covid tracking service that runs constantly in the background, and reconnects to that constantly running service to check keys a few seconds after being launched. This is why it takes a few seconds on launch to confirm tracking is active.	0

21000	1. Integrate with singpass or myInfo to get personal data. \n2. Let app scan for QR code. During scanning also allows Bluetooth to do its work. \n3. Let app detect location or user to select location in advance to prepare for check in, like what Singpass app used to do. \n4. Let user see which location is still checked in so that checking out is easier.	1

21007	The biggest problem with the cov19 Bluetooth API is that you need to have location on. I don't want to enable GPS all the time, as the app says it self, all apps that have access to location, can use it while enabling location for this app. Don't want GPS enable all the time. I known it's not the apps fault, but googles. Still has a big affecte on who gonna use this app.	1
21008	Ok	0
21009	The idea of developing this app for public concern is good, but while executing any application for public purpose, kindly look into all the possibilities of using app by the citizens without any hindrances, asof now many citizens including me can't able to register the application becoz they are asking QID and it's expiry date, as I am on family visit visa I have my passport and visa .it's my request kindly make an option in the app of putting passport number and it's expiry as we can also use	0

21014	Update: Lots of Improvement. However, the data transparency portion need improvement. E.g. Allow user to refresh to update the number of contacts made. 1. Interference with other bluetooth devices. 2. No simple data transparency to encourage users. E.g. "Congrats you have maintained social distancing today" 3. No data insights. E.g. a simple bar chart can make us aware of our social distancing effort and make improvement. 4. No option to allow us to turn off when at home.	2

21050	Its a fail for me - wouldn't accept my phone number and nowhere to report that.	2
21051	App tells me my phone number can\u2019t be recognised, and therefore I can\u2019t get a pin. Very annoying when you want to support an important initiative.	2
21052	No option to turn off app when not in use. Huge battery drain. Who would have bluetooth enabled always? Regardless of your internal testing and statistics, basing your data on the consumption % displayed on a Samsung phone is not the correct way. It is a known fact that the battery consumption is not accurate and you did not consider the consumption by bluetooth radio in your faq.	1

So unless some grows a pair, our corrupt leaders will sell our country to the CCP. Delete this app. Masks don't work against viruses. Experimental RNA vaccines are more dangerous than the virus.

21061	Excellent safety precautionary application. Also has great future potential. However, as with most people I have to agree that the application is too heavy on the phones systems. In addition it is not required to operate on the phone all the time as only required if you are out of the house as per MOPH instructional guidelines. Finally, I do not see why the application requires access to sensitive phone data such as"media". Pleass correct these issues to have a great tool against COVID19.	0

21068	Great initiative and effort, well done. Sadly my battery life is definitely affected by this app. My Bluetooth connectivity to my watch and headphones is also significantly more problematic. However, during these times we all have to sacrifice, but work towards fixing these (if possible) and make it better experience.	1
21069	Why this app don,t work some people mobile phone. it's can,t be installed.pls tell me what can I do. And someone give this app in my Mobile. But the app can,t be installed and in the corner have option run.	2

21071	Useless hassle It is useless in the sense that it doesn't give the right information. For example, it says that I am safe even when there might be covid cases in the surrounding area.	1
21072	Not sure if it has been mentioned. But do allow setting to allow off bluetooth upon connecting to certain wifi or certain timing. I.e at home or when sleeping as it doesnt make sense to be running at these timings.	2

Of course reactivating doesn't do much good.	1
21108	Phone number invalid and no options there to fix it. Good job! Typical really \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f	2
21109	It does what it sets out to do and does it well. Often apps like this feel poorly designed or hastily developed but its not the case here. One feature that I think its missing is the option to set up daily reminders to check in. Not a major setback (and this is usually something I'd hate to have in an app) but it may be a handy way to get check-in numbers to grow steadily.	0
21110	Not users friendly!! I completed my quarantine for 10 days and am still getting messages from the app saying don't levae ur quarantine area.I tried to contact MOH no one picking the call and putting me on hold for hours.this is the third day am calling them every hours but no response.	2
21111	I am giving 5 stars because it's better to use cheap solutions instead of the expensive ones.	0

21118	App was unobtrusive and (I assume) working okay. As of 18/12/20 update, battery usage is regularly over 14% draining the phone. Won't work too well if the phone is flat. Really poor timing coming into Xmas and NY I'll give it a while, but it will have to go if not fixed promptly LG V30+, Android 9	2

Without the app installed, but with my bluetooth and gps on, my battery lasts 1-1/2 days. With these options on, and the Covid app installed, it seems	0
21123	Battery life sucked out due to bluetooth keeps jamming my phone	1
21124	Can't register. App saying my mobile number is invalid. Have tried with and without the 0 at the front.	2

21130	After update, the app asking for a lot of sensitive personal data. Is this app really from SG Gov? Y cant we use singpass to login? Dont feel comfortable after the news of fake app and key-in so many personal data.	2

21137	Up to friday everything was fine. Noticed battery draining rapidly and more worrying phone getting hot. Have had to uninstall for now at least.	1
21138	I've had to take this app off my phone for the 2nd time due to how quickly it runs down the battery. This time my phone was also incredibly hot and I assumed it had just reached the end of its life (it's a Samsung, 3.5 yrs old). Then I came across comments online about this app, battery life and making your phone over heat. I deleted it and my phone is fine again! I'm hopeless with technology but can anyone give some tips on how I can reinstall without the battery and over heating issues?	1

21155	Useless app	1
21156	poor app...password or credential issues.	1
21157	Simple and straightforward, does what it needs to do, nothing more or less. Multiple independent reports indicate that privacy is adequately protected.	0
21158	It is very useful.	0
21159	Once i turn off the bluetooth and turn it one again then it stops working. So it only can be used only one time. I have to uninstall and reinstall it again to make it work. Its so bad. I hope it can be fixed.	2
21160	can't start the first step of registration... can mobile numbers starting with 89xxxxxx be added?	2
21161	A perfect balance between safety and privacy, huge props to the team involved. \n\nOne thing that should be made more clear: if you restart your phone you need to relaunch the app to enable exposure tracking again. My tracking history shows a 3 day gap because of this.	0

21170	Contact Tracing and early warning are a very important aspect in controlling COVID19, but making an app that is not very efficient like EHTERAZ is not really helping all people, esp imposing huge fine and jail time, it creates anxiety and panic to those having lower version of phone and having trouble with OTP request during sign up. Please have you technical staff replaced by more competent personnel. Thank you.	1

21187	Doesn't work without permanently enabling GPS and/or Wi-Fi based location, even though the app doesn't use either. Deal breaker for me as I keep location off for privacy reasons unrelated to this app. Apparently due to bad permission design on Google's side?	1
21188	This new update is everything the app needed, fixing the excessive battery use and adding so much more useful information. Going from having to screenshot day by day to compare the number of cases in my county, to have data on a daily, weekly and monthly basis is such a big improvement.	0

21238	Please ask telecom operators to send notifications to all users to download and install the app. Wide spread usage is required to get the full benefits. \n\nSupermarkets  may be instructed to let in customers with smartphones to have this app mandatorily.

21304	Tried more than 3 times, but otp is not sent to my mobile at all....	2
21305	Needs location permission to access Bluetooth low energy, but doesn't do location requests, so battery consumption is low. It happily coexists with the Italian immuni app. This is important if you regularly cross FR-IT border. In principle this app should be valid for MC. When you first install it may take a few retries to activate the service. Don't worry, retry some hours later. It doesn't ask for any data.	1

21318	I fully support the principle behind this app and have no issues around privacy whatsoever. The app however has bugs, mine is related to power usage. I normally charge my battery every 2 days or so.

21365	Even though I am in a low case province, NS, I feel safe knowing that when the second wave comes, I’ll be more vigilant because I have this app. If only this app was made mandatory for all Canadians with a cellphone.

21397	Just downloaded the app and use it in less than 3 minutes and it crashed? And I can't open the app. So I uninstall it. Make something usefull at least for once smh.	2
21398	A necessary app everyone should download it	0
21399	It should be possible to register multiple accounts (persons) on the same smartphone. Many adults and children do not have the skills, knowledge and / or compatible device to use the application.	0
21400	Stay safe PHA is an amazing app. You can spend more time in this app than expected. This app contains deceptive ads. This app looks very bad visually.	1
21401	I can't get access. The system will not accept my mobile number on my Android phone. Installed and uninstalled three times. To much effort so I give up.	2
21402	Not working at all.	2
21403	Very good app	0

21409	No issues, runs quietly in the background	0
21410	Good	0
21411	Kept the app from day one. While I'd love to keep the app it consumes huge amounts of battery in the background so ended up removing it. For an app of such importance im surprised performance testing is not a priority	1
21412	Exellent	0
21413	Just need to turn WiFi off to register your phone number. BTW Google knows more about vwhat you do via location services, smurfs and tracking than the Australian  Government will learn from this app.	2
21414	Lousy app. Keep crashing other apps..	2
21415	Tnx	0
21416	They're lying about the download numbers. The app also asks for access to gps, despite the government stating specifically that the app would not require this and that tracking information would not be required or stored. Blatant lies absolutely incredible.	2
21417	I downloaded this app as I thought it would be a more convenient way to order repeat prescriptions. However, after providing all my information during the registration process, including my NHS number (twice), entering codes sent to me by email and SMS, submitting four photographs of my driving licence, four photographs of my face, and two videos of my face while reciting numbers, it all appeared to be insufficient to prove my identity! After that debacle the app then froze on me! Unbelievable!	2
21418	Why its asking for permission for storage	1
21419	Very good	0
21420	Nice apps bd thanks	0
21421	consume lot of charge and it doesn't support on some mobiles	1
21422	What is this? Can't even sign in. Useless app. If can give 0 star I more happy. Waste time/data/battery.	1
21423	Simple and easy to register (after the 6pm start). Moved to Samsung setting to exempt app from low battery settings. For the time they had to set up, well done.	0
21424	Does not work. Just pages as we know it from AA provided.	2

21426	Good ! Now everyone use it so we can finally get over with this virus ! The more implication, the less time we still live with it !	0
21427	Easy to setup and use	0
21428	After a few updates it finally became the app that just runs in the background without impacting other apps, Bluetooth, etc. Its just there in the background and i don't even remember i have it installed	1
21429	why i can't use and open this app?	2
21430	I was usig the app effectively but since yesterday evening it has stopped and asking for fresh installation. This means that I will loose my past history which shouldn't have happened. Need help. Regards	2
21431	I could not open the scanning as it asked me to update google play services but i had already updated. I am using Xiaomi mi max 3 currently thank you.	2
21432	Too much memory space	2
21433	To increase trust and adoption this app should be made open source. That way, we all could have a look at the code to see if there's any privacy breach, and could even contribute with an English translation for the app. Plus, Denmark would set the example and other countries would follow. You might think that an open source app is more vuneravle to attacks but this is a very naïve arguments: vulnerabilities are exposed and fixed faster.	2

21441	Did you upload my Covid test results from private hospital	1
21442	Noob	1
21443	Battery drain on Motorola phone. I also have the battery drain problem so removed the app. I read in the paper that Google rolled an update but nowhere does it state how you can tell if you have received this update. Looking at the system updates tells me device is up-to-date but that the last security patch was the 1/1/2019.	1
21444	No display of info to give a sense that the apps is working. Not sure if the app is working in the background? Not advance at all. And no indication where will the data be stored? Not transpare	2
21445	I can not take photos for tracking in the new version 2	2
21446	Excellent map...very gud initiative by Gov.Saudi Arabia.It is keeping crowd in control especially at supermarket's.	0
21447	Not working	1
21448	Good premise... But since installing my phone has slowed right down. Cuts out other apps and disrupts Bluetooth connections with other devices.	0
21449	Disappointed in the typo-ridden form response to feedback. Simply acknowledge the exact complaint from the user! Poor performance in the dark. Singpass mobile seems to turn on night mode or smth. TraceTogether just gives darkness. resulting in a frustrated user and security guard. No, the govt isn't going to harvest your data with Bluetooth beacons all over the island. Yes, TraceTogether can access sensitive information on where you check in, like counselling services.	1
21450	After registering, the app blocks you from carrying out any other function. Couldn't make any screening appointments. No help or info tag either.	1

21455	I bought a new phone for this app since it's mandatory. The app was working yesterday . But today it's not working. It crashes all the time. Please fix it. We cannot go to work if the app is not working.	2
21456	Why does it crashed when I deny to accept in accessing my photos and calls??? It doesnt do anything with COVID or anything..its personal and private thing. I have my kids pictures and a lot of thing which I dont like to share. And why phone calls??? Why do you even ask if its not a choice anyway?	1
21457	Good ðŸ‘�	0
21458	Showing always error in requesting OTP	2
21459	I am trying to download the app but it telling me that my phone is an OPPO when it\u2019s an iPhone how do I add my iPhone	2
21460	Sending OTP error. Cannot log in.	2
21461	It would be great to be able to see the daily figures of new cases and any deaths as well as overall totals. At the moment daily new case figures are just show in a chart with no figures.	1
21462	I like it. Simple design & no privacy infringement. Plus English is really good! Needs a lot more downloads to be effective though. It's up to us!	0

21470	With the new timelime breakdowns per county this has become the app I wanted. Would be great to have push notifications on home screen to check-in for when I forget to do so in the app itself.	0
21471	Aside from the battery drain bump due to Google messing up the play services component, seems to be relative straight forward to use. Would be nice if the national picture and overall number stats provided last 7 day and 14 day versions as the total numbers aren't particularly useful at this stage. Maybe even provide per 100k numbers?	1
21472	After installing the app my phone stopped working	2
21473	Good application	0
21474	My son and I have TPG SIM only plans. At start of circuit breaker, the app does not recognize his mobile number - on trying to register the app. Message states \u201dinvalid number\u201d Adtwr waiting a few weeks, he just tried and found the number is accepted, but he cannot receive any OTP to verify his number. What should we do.. just give up?	2
21475	It never stays on. I've disabled battery optimization but still the app is only active for 10 minutes before it turns off. I'll scan the QR codes everywhere I go as tracking.	1
21476	When the app is installed and I'm connected to a device with Bluetooth and playing music, the music seems to cut out a lot. When the app is not installed it works fine.	1
21477	Can't even register. Keep telling me Validation failed due to my IC number. Stupid app! If the app is unstable and not ready, don't implement it.	2
21478	Cannot close apps after using. Unfriendly apps. Hated notifications icon alerts when off the Bluetooth.	2
21479	Nice and it help a lot	0

21493	I stayed more than one hour at some places ,but nothing happened. What if the person does not have this application? We would not know. It would be nonsense. Obviously anyone want to declare that they are sick, that they have the virus. Waste of time to have this app. Sorry.	1
21494	Drained my battery in 1 hour just as I was about to head out. Waited half an hour to recharge and then it did the same thing again.	1
21495	Constantly crashing problem	1

21504	I opened the app and said that I am good no symptoms and left it for a few days and it seems that app was not running since the 4th of August until the 6th when I reopened it, so when I was out on the 5th I could have been in contact with someone (e.g. someone who coughed in KFC). (1. Logs to see when the app last sent data.) (2. New cases in each county per 24 hours) (3. No Storage Permissions required for logging IDs Hi-CPU usage) (4. Weekly notifications something new, needs to be adjusted).	1
21505	Not turning on	1
21506	Safest app	0
21507	Excellent	0
21508	I feel this app should give you a date or date range of your possible exposure, while I appreciate the need for privacy, a date would give you more information on who that you have seen could possibly also be at risk and need to take precautions. You should be able to utilize some of the data you provide. Right now it is a bit vague and makes it challenging to understand your own risk levels.	0
21509	Not able to manually adjust my location	2
21510	Today after updates application is not working.	2
21511	It is a really amazing app (since it is the only Covid-19 app in Bahrain). And it fascinates me how it tracks other people????	0

21516	Every time i open this app after some days its automatically logout.every time we need to login. Before 2 month 4 person i contacted had corona ,but i didn't get any alerts or any notification. i just scan my recent contact details at that time its showing some of the contact person had corona.but i didn't get any alert or anything	2
21517	Useless	1
21518	It constantly turns off on screen save - it doesnt overide the screen/battery saver - almost pointless having it as it is off 90% of the time all by itself	1
21519	Very good apps	0
21520	I thought only bluetooth is used.. so why is Location also activated? Location is tracking and invading of privacy. News reports say only bluetooth is needed. Why was activation of location not highlighted to us? What is going on? Bad reply to my questions..if you know it's going to be activated, why is it not informed to all? Why hide?	2
21521	Not working , giving errors ?	2
21522	Very good	0
21523	Ever since I downloaded this app, my music got laggy or got cut off several times when using bluetooth earpiece. Very pissed off because of the lag of my music due to the app. Please kindly solve it if not, people would not want to use it.	2
21524	Too many bluetooth disconnections coming from this app. My troubleshooting days on finding out the cause has finally led me here.. Low community usage is due to the unusability and issues caused by TT. Please FIX IT..	2
21525	Good	0
21526	A high consuming of power and all the time using Bluetooth.	1
21527	Keeps sending me notifications that don't have any information on them, keeps waking my phone when I lock it and turns the Bluetooth automatically. I appreciate the initiative but it is extremely unecessary for the app to have access to my phone as well as media and storage on the device. Privacy is very important to me as well as others in Qatar and letting the government have access to people's personal data is a bit excessive	1
21528	Battery Killer. It was working fine until two days ago. Last night I went to bed with my battery fully charged to wake up with 20% left. Deleting!!	1
21529	Thanks KSA gov.	0
21530	I have only disabled bluetooth and enabled. The App cannot be reactivated and keeps stopping everytime I try to open it. I will be obliged to reinstal it. Booring. This is already the third time. It is absolutely necessary to have an App like this but if it continues I will remove it.	1
21531	Its a good app but i only have 1 issue. It keeps interfering with my bluetooth audio devices everytime the app scans every other trace tgt app and tokens around the area.	2

21543	nice	0
21544	Seems to be using excessive amount of battery. Update 28/08/20 Since the software fix my phone battery usage has returned to normal. Also with the last app update it is much better more information and you can now be informed re Covid 19 status in the country and your county. Much improved. Well done ??. Keep it up.	1
21545	Always force closed. I can't open this app.	2
21546	Had to uninstall as was irreversible crashing my Bluetooth that could only be fixed by pulling the battery out of my phone as it even locks up a normal reboot request.	1
21547	Very high battery usage from this app over the past number of days. 8% an hour of battery been used by the app. I do turn bluetooth off when I am at home and turn it on again when heading out. But I certainly dont want to be charging my phone 2-3 times a day! Developers can you look into this? As if it continues I will have to uninstall and I'm sure I'm not the only one and more people will follow suit.	1

21569	I experienced really poor Bluetooth connection strength (persistent glitches and stutters playing audio from phone to both car stereo and ear buds, with occasional disconnects from car and ear buds) while using this app. Uninstalled the app and back to perfect connection on both car and earphones. What gives?!	1
21570	BLANK SCREEN as many other reviewers commented. Not very professional for an app that is designed to save lives, frankly.	2
21571	If it saves life, it's worth it	0
21572	Nice	0
21573	After the first login, it keeps crashing.	2
21574	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
21575	Google have now updated their Android systems with "COVID-19 exposure notifications". This app doesn't use this facility yet, which may be one reason why it is proving to be virtually useless.	2
21576	Network error during installation after accepting the terms. Why make such a half baked app mandatory to install?	2
21577	Just team up with google. According to google, contact tracing apps doesn't use our location. Apparently, this one is. So that's why I deleted the app. And it keeps on scanning. Drains your battery!	1

21586	Keeps stopping, no notification. Ver 1.0.17 on Android. It often resets the battery optimisation permission. The app then says it's not active until I set the permission. Happens every few hours. There is no way of knowing it happened... - the green Australian logo with its tick is unchanged. The permanent notification says it's running. But tap on the notification and it says it's not, in fact active. Have filled in the error report but only got an automated reply. Left more details. Nothing.	1

21605	Drained my battery and my phone overheated. I installed app when it came out. I had to uninstall, my phone still not right which I need for work so now have to get a new phone. Ridiculous that such an important app should be having an important impact has caused these issues. I would like to reinstall but will not be taking the risk on my new phone. Very disappointing.	1

21609	Nice app	0
21610	I have uninstalled and re-installed this app several times now because after a day or so it just started crashing whenever I try to open it. Not sure what the problem is but so far this app has been useless for me. Hope this time it will keep on working smoothly.	2

21616	Please enable option to "Pause until I turn it on" or pause for X hours. Now I need to do a force stop through phone settings to close the app. With working from home as the norm, it can be days before I leave the house. Alternatively, allow users to setup a schedule to on and off. Or if the use of GPS is not a privacy issue, detect that the user has left a certain area and switch it on. Google maps now allows a user to specify home location.	2
21617	It drains the battery very quickly as it's always on In the background. Please work on this as we do not have chargers on us all the time. Duly noted. However this is the feedback I have to give as I have noticed my battery draining far quicker since I have made this app addition. Thank you	2
21618	Thank you for this very disappointing app!!! If only i could give a zero. I came back from my home country and finished quarantine, but it took 45 days for this stupid app to turn to green (informed the hotline but did nothing just told me "its okay, just wait". then, It turned green for only 2 days then it went question mark until now, did restarting my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled, called the hotline (did not helped a bit). Now, I can't even buy my own groceries for more than 2 months.	1

It is Huawei Mate 20 light, model SNE-LX1, EMUI 10 with latest security updates. Probably your application detects that I have Root Explorer installed. Please fix this Bug.	2
21623	When Ehteraz I try to open its close it automatically why	2
21624	It is just a spyware app. No need data connection? No need location? But tell you need to install on your phone which have data connects and GPRS. Not spying?? When is the token releasing?? Seriously I'm feeling uncomfortable having this app on my phone. Encounter severe spikes network from both my WiFi and data connection. If not for my workplace at chang North forcing us to download, I would not even let this app enters my phone. That's how this app is applying to everyone's hearts.	1
21625	Simply does not work. Can't get app to register me 'bad Internet connection' message.. But I've tried on like 5 different networks. They can't all be down while everything else that needs Internet connection is still working on my phone.	2

21644	Useless app. Once soneone gets positive after being close to you. This will not report it to you. Just a waste app.	1
21645	The app is good but the battery drain especially over the past two days has been ridiculous. Also, my phone was heating up excessively. I was afraid to leave it charging unattended but it was losing battery power so fast that not even using on the charger made a difference. I had to uninstall because I thought my phone was going to go Samsung and burst into flames. Since uninstalling it it's charging faster and my phone has cooled down.	1
21646	The app doesn't notify about risky encounters. Supposedly I had a risky encounter almost two weeks ago and I didn't get any notification. I just noticed it because I opened the app. I would expect to get notified about this. I have notification enabled for the app in settings.	1
21647	Use up too much battery. Go for work with 100% battery 6hr later battery left with 20%(never touch phone) if i use my phone 6hr already battery flat. And it crash all my other bluetooth device. Like playing music. Suddenly there's crashing sound at random times like your bluetooth is like more then 10 meter away	1

21659	I have a different scenario because I have a button phone which contains my Sim Card and the smartphone I am using doesn't have any Sim Card in it. So I am not sure if that's the reason I am not getting my OTP hence cannot create my account. Please fix it ASAP. There maybe many people like me who uses two different phone one with Sim Card and the other without the Sim Card, So it would be better if you guys take this scenario into consideration. Thank you.	1

21682	I had a contact alert at 6:00pm.  The next morning it was gone.  Was this a false alarm? If not the alarm should remain in the app until the user removes it.  Had I not been near my phone and gone to bed without checking it, as I often do, I would have missed the alert.  I fully believe in the concept of this app. However, I do think a narrower time frame should be noted in the alarms.  Even if I was informed that the exposure was in the previous 5 days or prior to that would be beneficial for monitoring for symptoms.	1

21720	Very intuitive app that will hopefully improve the contact tracing process. Would be nice if I could manually record daily temperature for historical analysis. It uses Bluetooth so it will be interesting to see if it has an effect on battery usage. The more people that have the app the safer we all are. Stay safe folks	0
21721	Very fair	0
21722	I think the Australian government is doing a fantastic job in the control of and response to covid-19. In this app we see the first real fail. The app does not sufficiently protect privacy. Google and Apple have worked together to produce an app which is completely anonymous and does not provide information to be stored on a government server. Thus this requirement can be easily met with pre-existing technology which makes me suspicious as to why the Australian government is not providing it.	0

Or any other ongoing processes to resolve the issue. Otherwise the government have to cease all the Huawei phones sales which is not assess the GOV.sg application untill resolve this issue.which can help the people those unknowingly purchase these phones	2

But if i use singpass safeentry it works - no internet issue I don't know why TraceTogether safeentry is so unstable. It is convenient - no login process needed unlike singpass mobile but always fails me. I just tried to reinstall, and now it refuses to work - i can't get the otp, it says i have a connection issue but all my other apps work fine and can get to the internet \ud83e\udd15	2

Can anyone help me on this. My office told go to any private hospital and do the test they cannot wait like that.	2
21733	Always says it's inactive	2
21734	Annihilates battery Had it for 2 weeks and all was hood then a couple of days ago my phone started reporting high cpy usage by the app and it started draining the battery like mad. Nearly full to low teens over night. Samsung S10+	1
21735	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0
21736	Facing similar issues as the others described. The app causes issues with other paired devices. However, I think this app has a bigger priority than our other devices for this period of time.	2

21771	After installing my battery life had gone bad overnight idle at home easily 35% gone the following day. When outside just merely 4 hrs not even using the phone much drain from 100% down to 60%.

21815	Would love to support it. I was able to register however I've noticed that with my Bluetooth headset - I have a NOTICEABLE delay of 5-10 of no audio when I answer a call. It's frustrating and annoying. Right now I'm isolated anyway so I'm not fussed but there will be others that connect their headset and in some cases other Bluetooth devices (namely keyboard and mouse) to their phone. I can do without the keyboard and mouse but it's very frustrating to have this consistent lack of audio.	0

21821	Battery drains fast.and y asking permission to storage. Error otp. Try again showing. After update not working.	1
21822	I downloaded the app, The first time i had my pcr test I didn't receive my result, even i put details correctly, So i did my second pcr test, the second time i received my result, But we are required to do the test again, I did pcr test for the 3rd time, But now no result again So frustrating.	2

21829	Doesn't have an Exposure Notifications badge ? on the app so I can't turn on Exposure Notifications in Settings. Galaxy S10 - software all updated and even turned it off and on again.... Will re-rate when I can get it to work. UPDATE - "Clear the Cache in Google Play Services" and it will all allow exposure notifications if you're having the same issue I had.	2
21830	While I installed this app.it worked only 15 days.after that a big question mark still now .why it's happened	2
21831	This does not work.\n For exemple if I am at a restaurant with plastic windows around me it does not take it in consideration. No app can be 2M precise, and even if you are behind a wall they cannot tell. \nWhich means in a majority of cases.\n This will stress people out more than help people out. \nIt’s a good idea, but we don’t have the required ressources to apply it correctly.	1
21832	Works fine on my phone. For security, I turn Bluetooth off, and deny location permissions, as soon as I return home. Also, i suggest to give it a fake name instead of your full name when you register.	1
21833	Still draining battery even though a fix was supposed to have happened. Have reinstalled, cleared cache...all the stuff that people were advising and I still find it draining. Unfortunately have had to uninstall it again	1
21834	Extremely BAD experience as no response & no help except for the preliminary cursory SOP answer/solution. We contacted Madhu of TraceTogether on 14, 18, 22 & 28 June 2020 on our OTP problem, but no solutions. We even helped Madhu by contacting our mobile service provider but nothing heard or done by Madhu of TraceTogether. We gave up.	1

21903	Useless When I am asked to take video the app will not continue what a waste of time	2
21904	It says error logging in when I try to register my number. Kindly resolve ASAP	2

21910	After the recent few updates, it has became the Top battery killer app. Taking up about 30% of my battery usage.	1
21911	The app clearly "knows" useful information: when you had a risky contact, how long, ... It only chooses not to tell you. Making it a waste of screenspace.	2
21912	Sucks thru ur battery!!	1

21919	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0

21924	Support the app and the principle but currently getting buggier - interferes terribly with my Bluetooth connected headphones and in car hands free, seemingly when it's near Many other devices and performing a handshake. Also not clear why it needs location permissions to operate when it is claimed that no location data is captured?	2
21925	It keeps crashing on my phone and it asks me to restart my phone. My solution is to uninstall and then install it again every two days! I wish to take part to stop covid but this app is not stable. Please fix it. Thank you.	2

No wonder theres a long Q to get the token when the government makes it compulsory to use them soon. The matter is resolve by updating app. Anyway i hv already taken the token.	2
21942	Such a pathetic app!!!\nNo information on proximity with contagious person. It gives you only stats. Such a waste of time and money (I suppose). The Council of Ministers should be more careful before relying on such misleading apps. Unless the main purpose is to collect personal data, is it so???!!!	2

21955	Absolutely abysmal battery usage performance samsung a20 not set to optimised. Allowed background, 1minute of background 13% total usage since 8am @ 1600hrs phone flat, there is no need for the app to wake frequently, it.hasnt even queried the android framework today for key matches.

I plugged out my phone and did not use at all for approximately 10 minutes and it drained my battery by more than 10% and overheated again.	1
21964	I have installed this app early when since this app started. And updated as accordingly. But now this app is not function anymore. My bluetooth is also failed to be activated. I have deleted and reinstall , I clear the phone cache too. But still fail. I'm using android phone. Can anyone help me? I have repeat same sequence. Uninstall and reinstall again today. Still not function. It says app not working. Why is that so? By allowing the bluetooth to turn on is still not good enough? How than?	2

21999	Again an app designed by morons. If you use bt, why need all the personal data? PDPA says only ask for the personal data you need for the task at hand. Is the government not bound to its own laws? Seems like. And then you have to keep bt on and running this monster in background - but you still have to scan into each and every location you enter??? You guys actually understand WHY you added the bt feature??? Seems not. Embarrasing.	2

22028	App frequently stops. Bluetooth switches off unexpectedly. These issues together with the fact that it depends on close proximity for an extended period of time makes the app ineffective for its intended purpose. As stated elsewhere in these reviews, it only takes the time for a sneeze or a cough to become infected. Still have it installed but not as optimistic as those in power are. A very disappointing app.	1

22054	Hi please resolve mobile start with 89xxxxxx cannot register... Urgent Updated.. resolved the issue that cannot register..	2
22055	Have installed the app but it's not very useful in protecting me as it requires me to have Bluetooth on all the time which is a huge battery drainer and only works if everyone also has their Bluetooth on. Good luck with that. Hence it doesn't achieve the goal of the app. Also, alerts don't work as you expect them to. Alerting me a couple of days later that I may have come in n contact with an infected person doesn't help me	1

22070	So your supposed to leave your bluetooth and location on while using contact tracing but this app drains the battery. Why can't you just use mobile data instead of bluetooth and what if people have other apps in the background while this app is running, can you please fix this issue.	2
22071	I tried installing multiple times but the process is not smooth n failed.	1
22072	Poor - : "invalid mobile number"! Not impressed! Can't progress any further!	2

22145	Overall a very easy to use app but completely drained my battery from just running in the background which has never happened with any other app :( I have to mostly keep my Bluetooth off now because it connected to my health app without permission and I don’t know how to disconnect it so it’s still draining battery when Bluetooth is on.	1
22146	OTP Password never received despite several attempts ,so not useful as of now	2

22157	This app interferes with the connection of Bluetooth devices and removed some functions of my music app. I had to uninstall TraceTogether and my music app, and re-install the music app to regain the functions. But somehow the Bluetooth connection is no longer the same as before. I never had any issues with my Bluetooth connections previously but there are constant breaks and jerks in the music now every few seconds, even after uninstalling this app. It broke my Galaxy S8 plus. \ud83d\ude21	2

22161	No idea how it's work. Everyday I got message that something is not wright, Bluetooth, or location permission. But application does not require any permission. So what is wrong? Reviewing after response: Everything is on, location and Bluetooth, but still not working. One star for now.	2

22169	I downloaded the app. When I accepted the terms..the app stoped working..would you please help?	2
22170	While I agree with the use of this app, and after checking it's permissions it does not track location. It does cause Bluetooth audio devices to drop out every 30 seconds or so.	1
22171	So waste app........	1
22172	I downloaded the app to my Xiaomi phone but it will not work. Is there some settings I need to change for it to work? Disappointing it will not work on all phones!!!	2
22173	Good	0
22174	Feel so tempted to just disable this app on crowded places because it keeps interfering with my other Bluetooth devices (eg Bluetooth earphones disconnects and cuts my phone call)	2
22175	Causes connection issue for my bluetooth devices. Hard to continue using even if I want to	2
22176	Fast and convenient. Would be great if there's a dark mode for this app.	0

22191	Good, would be great if it didn't automatically select your system language. I like English for my setting but not on every single app i use ??.	0

22199	OK	0
22200	Battery issues caused by Google Play Services appear to be resolved.	1
22201	The scanning is not consistent at all. After some months, scanning failed. The center line scroll up down couldn't scan at all. I have to Uninstall n reinstall, re register again. This is gonna be my 3rd time to do such actions again.	2
22202	Very good app	0
22203	So fine	0
22204	App developer should overcome IOS constraints and not use this as an excuse for bad UX.  Should add QR code scanner within App and users just need to scan location QR code like what they do in China.  Buses, MRT, other public transport, supermarkets, and all shops can have individual location QR code to enhance tracing efforts.  Now every business have their own scanning and queuing system and it’s so inconvenient for users.  Why can’t SG Govt have a SG-wide integrated system ?	1
22205	To run this app, Bluetooth have to be turned on which drains battery. Beside Bluetooth it also needs permission on wifi and gps which is also causing battery drainage and because if continuous access on wifi, Bluetooth and GPS, other apps seems laging even home launcher sometimes crush. It needs high end processor with inverter system. One star is more enough according to it's service.	0
22206	Did not receive the OTP. Pressed resend and no OTP being sent. Wasted 4mins waiting for OTP and still cannot register.	2
22207	I think it will be helpful for us.	0
22208	Worst app I want to sign up but when I enter my age it's not filling Like YYYY/MM/DD when Ienter data it shows like this 19850613 / sign is not appearing while entry.	1
22209	Since few days application is not working and having a question mark on the health status so Oooops you are stuck and cannot go anywhere... The way to fix it: Mobile settings/Apps/Ehteraz/Storage/Clear cache/Clear data/launch the app and try to re-register (you might need to try 2 or 3 times coz of error msg) if still not working, restart the phone and try to re-register. Finally you are green again !	2

22213	I like the reporting and symptom tracking but the app crashes so hard every time I use it that it freezes my entire phone. This is not good and should not even be possible. Please find and fox the source of this performance and stability issue. It's a major nuisance as it adds two minutes to my daily check-in and often encourages me not to bother tracking my temp or symptoms at all.	2

22221	Support English language	0
22222	Totally useless app which only shows that the Turkish government doesn't care about the thousands of tourists who have been stranded in Turkey since the beginning of the corona pandemic. It's only in Turkish, it doesn't accept foreign phone numbers so you can't even start using it. The question remains: How will foreigners travel by trains, domestic flights and bus in Turkey in the coming days if it's INPOSSIBLE to use the app for foreign visitors and you can't get a ticket without it ?	1
22223	Just we cooperate with govt efforts. Once day when every one installs this ap it will become useful. Hope so.	0

22231	I wanted to help but i failed registration. It keeps showing my mobile is an "invalid number" and of course i have tried both without putting the first number 0 or with 0 but all have been denied?	2
22232	after updating the App didn't need to open and a fly massage come say "try later ther is a problem in system " so could you plz solve that issue. thanks	2
22233	Seems fine and not much battery drain. However, can't say if it works and if it's efficient since too few people have installed the app. Welcome to the new era where Emocracy rhymes with Trumpidity of the mass.	0
22234	Previous version, I couldn't register. Kept prompting my i/C has issues. So didn't get to use e app. Now I have reinstalled after latest update, I can't get otp after enter my mobile number. Don't know what's happening. Please do something about it if you decided that we have to use this app by end of this year... Seriously.	2
22235	Since last night I have tried to install but the status always shows preparing to download. Till morning it did not install and shows no other status.	2

22263	After installing the Trace Together app, my Bluetooth will constantly disconnect when I am in a crowded place (e,g mrt, shopping mall). I will keep getting notification from my Galaxy Watch that it has disconnect from my Oneplus 7T. Wireless earphone will also disconnect constantly. I hope the Bluetooth for the app can be fixed and co-exist with my other devices.	2

22269	This keeps us safe, and the rating isn't about downloading the app. Rather, this apps negatively affects your phones functioning. 1) battery is drained at an insane pace!!! Full battery gone by noon (S10). 2) Bluetooth device disruption, both my buds and my UE Boom drop out often. Since uninstalling the app, both of these functions have returned to normal.	1

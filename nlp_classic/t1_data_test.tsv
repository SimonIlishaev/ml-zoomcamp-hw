0	The app keeps deactivating on its own and you need to go back into the app. It keeps saying set up is incomplete when I have already gotten it done.	2
1	Not much effective	1
2	Simple app, easy to activate and could save lives. Those worried about privacy might consider all the other myriads of data their smartphone sends out without their knowledge. You effectively forfeited your privacy when you bought the phone! Here you have the chance to save lives and the data has very strict access restrictions, so unless you have something to hide then do yourself (and others) a favour and download the app.	0
3	Its a great app. U can save yourself	0

11	The app can't work for me, can only uninstall. My phone will kill it no matter what, even if I ask it not to.	2
12	It drains your battery way too fast smh	1
13	not good i cannot register!	1
14	Can't register. The app says connect to internet even internet is connected	1
15	Useless . There apparently a cluster 100m from my house. Would have thoight this is the perfect way to keep people informed. Seriously need to be able to opt in for location sharing and no 15min bs. Some people are willing to forego a little privacy to be able to collect the info required to keep this under control	2
16	This app is so lousy. Cannot be installed on Huawei phones and androids of older OS. It also must be connected to wifi or mobile data. It also cannot use the QR scanner as an independent entity for SafeEntry, so without internet access this app is useless. Should have more languages too.	2
17	very useful	0
18	Please tell me the reason of "Something went wrong, please try again later". Everytime I ask for a permission I receive this message. Now how could I go out and get food for myself on the second day of Eid please tell me ?	2

31	Dear Team Bahrain, I appreciate your efforts to help keep us safe. However, I've been asked to upload selfies 4 times and I'm still half way through day 1. As I'm trying to work from home, this is proving to be rather annoying. My friends all have done the quarantine with the app but none of them are CONSTANTLY asked to submit photos. Please minimize asking us to submit photos every hour. I really don't think I need to submit over 60 photos in the span of 10 days and it's honestly annoying.	0
32	So far it works - but you should offer a TL;DR version of the mandatory introduction (the part of "how the app works", which is very clear for technically inclined people, but could deter some by its length and technicality)	0
33	i just started using it but it looks like a great idea and that will have many benefits. Keep up the good work.	0

35	Best app service god bless u all	0
36	When there are a lot of people nearby, eg shopping mall . MRT, it causes Bluetooth disconnected and reconnected 5s later. Results my Bluetooth earphones can't use normally. Work around: force stop this app.	2

44	Useless app. I am a direct contact of a covid positive person and this app didn't bother to inform me anything. Around my area there are so many positive cases, specially in super markets where we regularly go for groceries which I came to know through friends and neighbours. What's the use of this app?	1
45	Good	0
46	Why the app wants to access to my media files and phone calls? Location ok, I can understand.	1
47	Minimal info required to get setup. Has worked solidly for days since installation. Seems to have had minimal to no impact on battery life.	1
48	So good	0
49	Good	0
50	Doesn't remember my details	2
51	This app impacts on my Bluetooth functionality too much. I'm using a pair of BT earbuds and had no issues with them until I start using Tracetogether App. Now the earbuds keeps getting disconnecting and reconnecting which frankly is getting on my nerve.	2
52	Give it a go. easy to set up.	0
53	good	0
54	Too much interference, my radio app keep getting cut off, battery is draining faster with bluetooth on.	1

60	I like the idea of this app but it kept crashing my phone. Would be better if you were able to turn it off when ot needed. Had to uninstall it because it prevented me from answering calls. Which defeats the purpose of having a phone.	0
61	App registration was quick and simple, no issues.	0
62	Phone overheating, battery gone from 100% to 0 in less than 3 hours. Worked perfectly well beforehand.	1

69	TBH if its going to notify me while at work that someone has tested positive, then great stuff! I work customer service and have people from everywhere still coming thru the doors (service station) so that to me is a huge positive! No issues with this app, having Bluetooth on its not that much of an issue so not sure why people are going on about it. Been enough experts and people involved in the app speaking up about it for me to be happy.	1
70	From last 10 to 14 days app has stopped sensing users which comes in bluetooth proximity, as it's now not showing data to be updated to server and number of proximity count is decreasing day to day. while working in busy work environment and aftera reinstalling app,status is still same, app is not able to discover other aarogya setu app users through bluetooth proximity. Also same status with other aarogya setu app being used in other phone. So please check.	1
71	Good	0
72	If this actually showed something to prove it was working, say IDs or part of Id of other devices it had a handshake with or something such as the number of hand shakes or some other stat info that could prove it was actually doing something it would extremely helpful as it stands it is a blackhole app that appears on this unit to keep stopping unless in the foreground, not what one wants from something like this.	1
73	Useless app, i have Installed it more than 40 times , still it wont work properly.. my Bluetooth device is on but it keeps on saying to switch on my Bluetooth, if i close the whole app gets closed..	1

91	Works as intended. Bluetooth doesn't drain the battery as badly as expected. I would come home with ~80% battery charge if I didn't use it for anything else (such as GPS, etc). It's worth the minor hassle in a exchange for our freedom	1

What should we do.. just give up?	2

99	The new version works fine even though I had to retry 2 times to activated. I hope it can slow the pandemic	0
100	Basically made to spy on you. I'd rather install an app from the North Korean government than this. Reply to the person who replied to me: That's not the point. It sends false messages. It's useless and makes me feel unsafe.	1
101	Good app	0
102	The pros: - It registers and automatically checks-in really quickly. - Easy-to-use UI. The cons: - Absolute battery vampire. - Interrupts Bluetooth connection to earbuds. (Goodluck yall. My music was interrupted at least 3 times while typing this review.) Please give us an update on when the disruptions will be fixed. I'm actually contemplating downloading a shady QR scanner over this. (Oops it cut my earbud connection again.)	2
103	The app was okay when i intially installed it but after updating its only showing a question mark(?)	2
104	Useless app ever experienced and in case nit functioning need to call 109 which is chargable call not a tollfree number	1
105	very nic apps	0
106	It would be good if this app also worked with restaurant covid-19 safe plans so that you could scan the restaurant's QR code and it automatically associate the fact that you have been at that restaurant.	0
107	Turn off wifi when registering in the app. Wifi seems to cause issues with phone number registration sometimes	2
108	Thousands of cases in isb and its showing just a handful in radius alert. Seems all govt can do is make twenty different apps for one thing and then not update them.	2
109	Impossible to do activation. Not working on my Samsung	1
110	Doesnt work at all.	2

122	Effective app,we are with SG United	0

135	Failed to register, user/v2/register does not exist	2
136	No option to turn the app off for some time. Would like to turn it off while at home playing some games and this app makes trouble by running in the background. No big ram usage however always on notification, Bluetooth and background running memory with no option to turn it off manually is a negative. But overall support the idea	2

142	Not sure if it's me only but the app is causing interference to the proximity sensor to malfunction when i have incoming calls. Phone screen will auto blank out whenever incoming calls are picked up and hence cannot end call or access number pad or turn on speaker mode at all. Because of this i have to uninstall this app until the issue is fixed. I'm using Google Pixel 3A XL. Thanks.	2
143	Thank you for the developers for upgrading the app and adding english language	0
144	No issues with blutooth. I suggest people who are struggling with that in the car, turn the radio ABC news on instead of spotify, to keep up with yhe news? Then your phone is free for calls. And get an extra charger for work and car, to deal with the battery drain. These are tough times. Now IS the time to deviate from our comfort zone.	1
145	It was fine but now is draining the battery and overloading the CPU	1
146	Cant download the app	1
147	drain Batteries	2
148	The battery drain is unprecedented. If I want to use only safe entry this app doesn't allow, it needs Bluetooth by default. Instead make it optional, if we are running low on battery at least we can make use of safe entry to check in or out. It is all or nothing at present that is one of the reasons people are reluctant to use it and rue about it.	1

151	Easy to install and activate. Perhaps can include auto reading of otp so older folks dun have to fumble to check sms and key in otp. More publicity is also needed to expediently increase use of this app. Else it will not be as useful as it ought to be.	2
152	It was working fine but on 30th July after updation it starts crashing again and again whenever I tried to open it. Kindly fix this issue	2
153	Very useful, necessary and smooth functioning.	0
154	This application doesn't support Huawei Pro40. I am unable to DL on my new mobile.	2
155	It interferes with all my bluetooth devices. Cannot listen to songs nor watch videos. It will cause my videos and songs to stop abruptly for 30s to a min. But once uninstalled, my songs and videos plays normally.	2

I tried to turn Bluetooth off and then on, same result in the app.	2

203	MU app is not working please help me out	2
204	Great innovation to contact tracing. However, from my few days experience, it may affect: 1) Wireless earpiece, connected via bluetooth, to your phone as it may disrupt your music from time to time with 1-2 seconds pause and resume. 2) Battery drainage, usually my phone would last from midnight till the next night but as this app runs in the background it uses up my phone battery and I have to charge it more frequent than I used to.	2
205	The purpose of the app is great. However, had to uninstalled the app, after two days using it, noticed that my phone battery would not last for more than a couple of hours. Also, all the other apps on my phone start crashing. I will wait for new version to download again.	0
206	App does not work. Stuck at a screen when registering	2

232	The app take Time to down loaded	2
233	Keep disconnecting my Bluetooth headphones. My battery life was drain like nobody business and just for fark sake of my company forcing me to download or I get fired. This is definitely not a medical app.	2

267	The app says you're safe if you say you have no symptoms. It requires you to have your Bluetooth turned on at all times. Absurd. Privacy risk for sure	1

274	Once you activate the Bluetooth required for this app it then stops all other devices that use BT from functioning correctly! As the government won't be paying my fine for driving and talking on my phone I have no choice to get rid of this app til you can fix the bugs!	1

287	Battery saps very fast because Bluetooth have to be on all the time for the app to work. Why not use GPS signal instead? Or Wifi.	2
288	Good	0
289	It did not work.it says something wents wrong and you have to be in saudi arabia to use this app.	2

294	It chews through the battery usage. Have to recharge through the day as well as at night. Other than that, it just sits there unobtrusively in the background.	1
295	Can not start, keep chrasing	2
296	QR code cannot scan dark camera image pls fix after this new update.	2
297	Like the new interface after the update. How does this daily exchange users work? I stayed at home whole day, left my phone on the desk. Now I have 950+ users exchanged? Is this right?	1
298	When I update version 1.7.1, 50% of battery charge drained in 6 hours. Not able text any message (Keypad not enabled for few hours, this second time I facing this issue) in any application. Mobile also getting too much heat. Developer's please take action.	1
299	Cannot even go in. Keep on temporary unavaible. Not gonna install ever.	2
300	Input my NRIC to register and validation failed!	2
301	Similar problems experienced by most Users here. My Bluetooth earphones would "Blip" (sound disappears then reconnects) at least twice for each song which can get annoying. Drains battery life (using an S9+) like a glutton. Please fix!! P.S. Will be resorting to using the Token instead because of the abovementioned issues soon.	2

313	Workers need to install TraceTogether before they can be cleared to go back to work, but the app is uncompatible on their (older) samsung phone! Understand from an earlier feedback post that the TraceTogether team is aware and working on it, but really hope it can be expedited! Contractors alr losing money as it is, cant expect them to buy new phones just for this app..	2

329	Update 11.08.2020. Reinstalled. Ok so far. Worked fine but as reported elsewhere it isn't working now. The battery on the S7 went from full charge to dead in 2 hours or less . Usually it would last a whole day without charge. Deleted 10 Aug as waited 3 days for a fix and worried phone be damaged by over heating and not able to use phone	1
330	Yh it's a good idea if you're 6 years old assuming that everyone is going to download it... A small childish idea where we all live in a utopia downloading this app at the same time... This only works if the government forces you to download it by law... Only downloaded because I thought there was going to be a surprising new idea to uncover... Yh turns out it's like Pokémon GO without any Pokémon	1
331	This is a very good apps at this crucial time. Should take one step further to make this apps mandatory n/or to work with the telco provider to push through this apps into all handphone in Singapore just like the telco provider owns apps.	0

337	This app has an bug to my phone, when log in screen appears, it immediately crash	2
338	So good	0
339	At last, there's a way to pause. But why restrict to 8 hours only. Why not indefinitely until resumed by user? Using NRIC for SafeEntry defeats the purpose of using random number for exchanges. All places I visit get my NRIC. What's the point of a random number?	2

350	When will the problem with battery draining be solved ? While I realise the app is important to have , I will have to delete if not resolved pretty soon as my phone is not safe as it is draining from 100% to 35 % in 2.5 hours and it is very hot.	1
351	This app uses a lot of power. It almost ended my full batt by noon. Not easy for me to integrate this into my 3+ years phone. I've Uninstalled it. Personally find this app redundant with all the safe entry and nric logs. Best protection is still physical protection.	1
352	@ZAIN /@MOH / @CAIT :Please start replying to issues raised. This is so important for all of us What's your helpline number? Do you have anyone to answer calls 24X7?	2

361	Scanning of qr code cannot work. Tried to scan for 2 days safe entry code but it only pop up error message to ask me if the qr code is indeed the safe entry code. Alternatively, my fren managed to scan using the same app. Why?	2
362	good	0
363	Again, still doesn’t work with Apple’s password manager. People have a hard enough time trusting the government, so please update the app to allow the native password manager on iOS randomly generate a password. Mainly so the conspiracy theorists can no longer latch on to the narrative that the government is “intentionally” leaving this feature out so that they can collect people’s email and passwords. Will keep waiting till the next update...	1
364	Seems ok, easy to set up and use, on android 9. Can easily turn off bluetooth at home etc if want to save some battery, turn on when go out. However the within 1.5m and for 15 min to record any interactions for 21 days ? Why 15 mins ? Is that a tradeoff ? Could it be say 5 mins or less ? Less time the more chance of app being effective I would of thought. Have not seen anything saying 15 mins is a level that will capture almost all interactions worth capturing or have I missed something ?	1
365	Same old problems as the very first version it was released. Different brands of Bluetooth earphones/headphones keep on disconnecting especially in crowded places. Mentioned the first version, till now still the same. Think I go get token better. Give up on this app.	2

396	Needs location permission to access Bluetooth low energy, but doesn't do location requests, so battery consumption is low. It happily coexists with the Italian immuni app. This is important if you regularly cross FR-IT border. In principle this app should be valid for MC. When you first install it may take a few retries to activate the service. Don't worry, retry some hours later. It doesn't ask for any data.	1

520	Note, there are times I want to check out, but the app keeps getting hanged. Kindly resolve. Also your scanning in and out of MRT is a sad joke. We scanned in, when we arrived at our destination, we are checking out from the station we check in. Surely, for MRT station, you should have a QR code for checking out. Especially, if we are transferring from one line to another line. The link is lost, and we end up losing track of whether we checked out. Most ppl ignore the QR code check in/out.	2
521	FRUSTRATING app. Will not allow you to log-in. Always prompting that there is an ERROR despite numerous attempts of encoding correct personal info. In the face of this pandemic, the Admin should fix whatever is derailing this app to save UAE communities and lives.	1

Millions of us download TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram for mere entertainment without any qualms about privacy, so let's put aside differences in opinion for a few months and do whatever it takes to get us back to normal.	2

I contacted the call center everyday in the past 4 days and they say it will take 24 hrs to be resolved. Pls resolve ASAP	2

630	Trash app. Goes against everything a value added app should offer. Not to mention this App has GARBAGE UI. Has SEVERE Ratings for almost all of Nielson's 10 Heuristics. Extremely high Gulf of evaluation & gulf of execution. All in All, extremely disgusted with this app. Using this is like being force fed combat rations. Sure it helps keep you alive; but it's disgusting and at that point in time you'd wish you weren't alive instead.	1

My wife has just tried to join via her phone and she is getting the same results, invalid phone number. Yes, we have tried dropping the zero as well. Yet my two daughters had no problem completing the join up. Weird.	2

651	I'm repeatedly being told that I'm in the red zone and I should move. My home is in the red zone, what do you expect? And no option to turn off the annoying red zone notification. And also repeated forced close. I understand this app is for contact tracing, but many people don't. Instead of adding more features that will eat more space, why don't make installation of this app obligatory for all citizen?	1

Just checked my battery usage from it not sure if it is from an update but some how it has used the most battery of any app on my phone... in 20hr standby had used 32% of battery (s20+) double of any other app. Worse so far today in 26% in 12hr. No wonder i have to keep charging now.	2

704	I never have my Bluetooth turned on all day cause it drains the battery and is a source for intrusive spyware. This app is useless and will not protect you from the virus as has been witnessed in Singapore, but it's an invaluable tool for the police to watch your every move and maybe even fine you if you breach social distancing rules. The age of tyranny and persecution is amongst us thanks to this virus that was created in a lab.	1
705	Great app. It just works fine compared to others. New version is covered all necessary to updates, such a short period of time, Ministry is able to develop this app that fetchs data from hospitals and health institutions. ??	0

712	After installing app battery drains super fast. It also caused my samsung smart watch to frequently disconnect from my phone, which causes alot of inconvenience. App should be optimised so that these two things does not happen.	1
713	Very helpful to us especially in this time of pandemic.	0
714	All of a sudden ask to get camera permissions but there is no camera permission setting in the app permission settings. \nI have been using the app for a while without a problem, but now this is causing me to not want to go anywhere, because I need to type manually details.	1
715	The app gives good if basic information but I had to uninstall it as it drained my battery in a matter of hours.	1

736	At last, there's a way to pause. But why restrict to 8 hours only. Why not indefinitely until resumed by user? Using NRIC for SafeEntry defeats the purpose of using random number for exchanges. All places I visit get my NRIC. What's the point of a random number?	2

But, after several updates, a notification appears, "your device has been detected as having root access" while the device has never been and is not in the rooted state even though there was no notification before and now the application cannot be opened and used.	2
805	Would not recognise my phone number so I can't use it	2
806	Drain batteries	1

822	Dear Admin, I installed the app perfectly and login with my ID & password. I have even obtained message today for 2 hours permisson. But same time app became out of order. Now neither I can login nor sign up again and error is "something went wrong pls try again later". Kindly advise.	2

827	On 07.08.2020, it started draining phone battery very fast	1
828	Would be good if this app had a feature that allowed the user to leave details with cafes or restaurants. With 100s of untraceable Covid cases in Vic it seems the app isn't doing what it was supposed to do ...?	2

831	Good	0
832	After updating, it always have the error message : Verification failed at the NRIC section. Give up.	2
833	In phone settings I needed to setup a custom power profile to enable this app to run in the background. Otherwise the app will stop due to the phones default power saving profile. It didn't restart automatically. It didnt restart if I rebooted the phone. App info says "There is nothing else to do except leave the app running and keep Bluetooth on. In fact you need to configure the phones power setting for a custom power profile and allow app to run in the background. Oppo Reno2 Z Colour OS V6.1	1

871	App causes music to be interrupted every few seconds on blue tooth heaphones. And extra battery drain. Makes my brand new bluetooth headphones useless. Cant listen from my phone at all.	1
872	It won't work if every covid patient does not install this app and turn bluetooth on. Also not sure whether the users need to update their covid info or govt will sync with covid test result!	2
873	Very nice	0
874	the App is taking over the phone, then keeps on switching on both bluetooth and gprs if switched off its draining our mobile phones charge its ever on and it cant work if not given permission to access gallery and phone contacts of which am not of the idea i need privacy no being monitered all the time..... another thing who needs all that radiation by tha way from phone waves, bluetooth waves, gprs i dont want to die cause of cancer as i protect my self frm Corona virus	1
875	It causes severe interruptions when streaming audio via Bluetooth, pauses in the audio by up to 30 seconds. As someone that uses bt headphones, speakers at home and car audio this is a complete frustration. FIX IT, IT'S BEEN A KNOWN ISSUE FOR FIVE MONTHS.	1

There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0

912	As with a lot of other users, I am experiencing battery drain with this app. On a nearly new Samsung A70 that would usually last 3-4 days on a charge, now only last almost 24 hours. This app is now uninstalled. Trust is a very important value between developers and users and I am sad to say, you have just lost my trust.	1
913	Phishers everywhere buttons don't link overlaps also you have massive security issues....i am chantell Anne and would like to help once given correct information	1
914	The app won't accept Norfolk Island mobile numbers. Norfolk is part of Australia and should be able to use the app as well.	2
915	I got my test results in pure heath site long back. But this app shows no results. Unnecessarily consumes data and battery power as ot needs Bluetooth to be activated.	1
916	The app has technical problem , it,s unable to install	2
917	Where do I take photo of sign it at cafes.. Got refused service today at Valla after I took photo but it didn't register	2

920	The new update require users to enter NRIC details and turn the colour of icon red. It does not help in provide confidence in the data security and protection. There should be options for user to decide if they are comfortable with keeping NRIC details in the phone, and explain on the reason for this function.	2

947	The most useless apps in my phone, thanks for having me installed this apps since my HR told me to, and ends up constant battery drain due to bluetooth stayed on, hahahah	1
948	Get rid of the notification saying it's running that you cant clear from your screen. Annoying, the app should be a download and forget. Additionally it's a bit amateurish to have a " :) " emoji at the end of the notification. I have deleted app and am not the only one.	1

966	i keep requesting for OTP code but got nothing!!!! tried for about 5 times, still nothing, and they friggin BLOCK my number!!!!!! I give up.......fix your mess pls.	2
967	Doesn't work without giving explicit location permissions, the whole point is that it shouldn't need direct location tracking. Also shouldn't use AWS - it's not like a text file containing a contact list is a lot of data, just send it straight to the state's public health authority rather than through the US. It doesn't matter that you promise not to use the permission, you've already broken our trust with abuse of metadata collection and technical protections are far better than empty assurance	1
968	Received instruction to update today, was told update button at this site, but there is no update button shown.	2
969	The app is extremely laggy and expensive in terms of power. It also isn't worth the cost of my blue tooth on the whole time. In addition, I do not want to give my consent to share my private information with the government, and so it doesn't allow me to use it.	1
970	Does not seem to be working	2
971	The app had disrupted my other Bluetooth connection especially Bluetooth car kit and fitness watch. Even after uninstalled, I am not able to re-pair my devices. I have to reset and erase all my Bluetooth devices and re-pair them.	2
972	They didn't send me an OTP . Checked my hp no to see if its correct but to no avail	2
973	Very good	0
974	Good ! Now everyone use it so we can finally get over with this virus ! The more implication, the less time we still live with it !	0
975	Doesn't alert you to infected cases in your area. Drains battery pretty fast due to Bluetooth connection. Not sure how this app is supposed to work as there's not much info coming from it. Also don't think personal data will be a concern for public health measures if it means improvement for the app. Just add a consent check box. Whoever wants to download obviously have no worries to share personal data by telco.	1

982	After clicking on Favorites, the app should go to screen with Family members to select. Currently once click, it immediately checkin individual. Then on have to checkout, go to Family, select family and then scan QR.	1
983	The app was good but since yesterday all pins have gone missing in Multan and Lahore.... essentially its now just one page of numbers and less information then even website	2

1023	The app is perfect except for the privacy issue, which protonmail has explained succinctly. If the app doesn't work, look in your battery saver settings to see if your default phone settings are overriding the app settings.	0
1024	In the latest update, after we update key personal data such as NRIC number and NRIC expiry date etc, our data will be saved. These data can be obtained simply by opening the app. No login is required. Even the Singpass app which is also able to produce our NRIC barcode requires an authentication login to access the data. Please rectify this immediately. I can't even "log out" delete the personal data.	2

1031	Please explain why there are more than 100 bluetooth exchanges on the app when one does not even leave home the whole day? Is that a defect?	2
1032	This app has no effect on any aspect of your life unless you come into contact with someone else who has the app AND also has a positive test for COVID. all the scare-mongering about it comes from morons.	2
1033	Why does this need 103MB?!	1
1034	Cannot install in my huawei phone	2
1035	This Bluetooth Connected App is a poor functioning 'Battery Killer'.. Needs rethinking. Halved my near new Samsung's battery time.	1
1036	Not enough information on how to use the app. I am not tested yet how the app will help me? My children are on visit here in UAE and the do not have Emirates ID how they can install the app as they are subject for infection like any resident, kindly add the visit visa number or Unified Number as ID number with more information how to contact visitors.	1

1045	Excellent	1
1046	Works perfectly fine. Tracing protocol is designed for privacy, only Bluetooth is needed. No GPS, no mobile locations! There is a great transparency about this open source app and a lot of online resources (Wikipedia, github, etc.) Privacy is of much lesser concern than with Facebook, Whatsapp & co. This innovative app can only effectively help breaking chains of virus transmission if it is widely adopted. So install it and help make Switzerland safe again :-)	0
1047	On...Off problem. If anyone else is having the problem this should help. When you first install the app, it requests certain permissions, these I gave, and this should then overide any general app permissions on your phone and treat this app as an exception because you agreed to allow them, this works for the other apps on my phone, however, with this app, for some reason, you need to go into your app management and give the permissions exclusively for the covidsafe app.	2

1054	Why can I still see my NRIC date of issue in the app? It should be also masked after the app has verified the date of issue. This info can be used to reset a Singpass password.	2
1055	Good	0
1056	v1.0.39 for Android is a dud. After this update was installed on my phone, the appl displayed "COVIDSafe is not active" instead of active. The settings in the appl now needs the permission change "Location: On" to go into the active state. Users should not need to change the appl settings for COVIDSafe for it to continue to operate correctly after an update. Also, if you enable this permission in the appl and then turn off the phone's Location/GPS, then "COVIDSafe is active" is shown in the notification bar but "COVIDSafe is not active" is shown in the appl - So is it active or not?	1

1082	Good app	0
1083	After the developer replied, I see now that it's a nice Idea, and that it works fine, just not as I expected, i have two confirmed cases in my building and another one in my classroom but this app showed nothing even after two weeks. It seems it is to protect the affected IDs and keep cases anonymous, so it will only show an alert if I cross with someone I don't know at a public place, which is good overall.	0

1092	Good app.	0
1093	good work but patients ratio not correct	0
1094	So far so good. I will get tested in due time and will upload my result to the app, so that it can do it's job by upping the game on contact tracing.	0
1095	This app good for covid19 ...	0
1096	It interferes with other apps. Had to uninstall to use other apps.	2
1097	When you register for the app, the system will send you an OTP. The first OTP regardless if you typed in correctly or not will fail. Only on second OTP the registration will pass. Entering your birth and NRIC issue date, regardless of what year you typed in, it will default to "1970" after you accept it. It is only when you scroll to your birth year or NRIC issue year manually, then it will be correct. Do you guys check your work? This will cause massive data entry errors on your app.	2
1098	Good	0
1099	As soon as I've finished this review I will be deleting this app. (*Edit I reinstalled app cos I felt to guilty even if others are d-bags) The whole point of this app is to protect others as a community, well the Australian community has made it clear it doesn't care. As a disabled person I am once again highly impacted by the hording that the rest of the "community" has been doing. Today on a pointless trip to the supermarket i noticed only ONE other person wearing a mask (Victoria).	1
1100	Very bugged. Consume lots of battery.	1
1101	Very bad app i cannt ad my adress	1
1102	Your Bluetooth function has drain my battery within a day. Very irritating, if it is not instruction by my management, i shall uninstall it.	2

1109	Can you make the APK available for download for users who may not have Singapore listed as their home Google play store? Thanks.	2
1110	App installed smoothly. However failed to add Emirates ID with error "user not found". Where as COVID-19 test attended twice with the same ID number. Needs bugs fixing at earliest as its very important for public	2
1111	Absolutely horrendous and not thought out. It asks me to give my nric issue date which I cannot as an NSF. Given that if I'd like to sign up for it on a weekend there wouldn't be anyone to answer my query would there? I also can't sign up using my singpass. Unnecessary information collected as well. Terribly implemented app made "mandatory but not compulsory" with no user experience in mind. First time I've gone out of my way to review an app, and it's a ZERO star review to tracetogethe	2
1112	Very poor	1
1113	App won't install after download. Please fix. Will resort to mobile browser for the meantime.	2
1114	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
1115	Easy to install. Works ok. For an app financed by belgian authorities I would have expected a multilingual (Fr, Nl, G) interface... This will increase adoption rate !	0
1116	Very confusing and not up to date. Get rid of the battery draining waste of time.	1

1125	Bad. Spotify becomes intermittent immediately when I download this app. The music keeps on skipping and pausing. I had this issue when you first launch this app. But I uninstalled it bcos if this issue. Apparently nothing has been done months after I uninstall. This is a big hassle for me. Pls do something. Phone: Note 8 Firmware: Up to date android.	2
1126	Breaks Bluetooth functionality. Also so resource-heavy that it makes phone feel 10 years older. Highly tempted to delete it.	1
1127	Tracking is very bad please solve this issue	1
1128	App is not working	1
1129	Good aap	0
1130	Everyone should use it BUT it absolutely devestates battery life. If you dont optimise it it will defeat the purpose as people will be walking around with phones off due to flat batteries or remove the app.	1

1137	Drained the battery on both my phone and my Fitbit because they both use the bluetooth. I going to take a guess and say the app won't work if the phone goes flat	1
1138	The Bluetooth exchange seems like not working. Activating the apps and walk around also zero exchange.	2
1139	It's a really good app to stop stpreading the covid-19	0

1150	No PIN received upon installing	2
1151	Just download the app... due to mandatory soon. Unfortunately stuck at the OTP. If thd App is not ready for the public it should not be implemented island wide. I'm wling to support the trace togetacticity but your app really not ready for the whole public. Please look into it immediately.	2
1152	Pure dogshit	1
1153	Validation issue. Please fix asap	2
1154	Why does my anti malware program say this is infected when I try to install for travel?	1
1155	Where is the source code? Is public money and is tracking out location, source code to be able to trust it. Edit: thanks for the response, but other European countries does open their source code to allow the public to trust it. Even when is a failure. Uk for example.	2
1156	totally stop working. how many days I keep try to login but still lock! since then this is the requirements for all facilities to enter, I hope immediate monitor of admin is a must and agent availability is always open 24 hours to reach out!	2
1157	I used this for a while until I realised it was the cause of all my Bluetooth sound problems - it makes all my music playback via Bluetooth skip frequently for 1-8 secs or so. Uninstalled it and all is fine again. Edit: Developers response seems to be standard reply for everyone reporting this problem. What other details do they need?! There is apparently widespread BT interference in this app that uses BT scanning. Happening on all our latest Samsung phones, Android 10.	2

1175	Troublesome lagging app. It takes so long to load. And when I need to on Bluetooth to let it run, it lags. Then I gotto exit the app and refresh it and on it back again to wait for a good 20seconds before I can scan. Nothing wrong with my brand new phone	2
1176	Easy to install and if you are at all interested in safety you should have it. The gov't know everything anyway!!! LOL	0
1177	Nice app	0
1178	Does not work!!! Has been uninstalled. Great work government!!!!	1
1179	The fact that it's displaying a consistent notification without an option to dismiss, is: 1. Annoying; 2. When I'll get a real notification about being exposed to a sick person, I won't bother checking what's in the notification, because I always ignore the app notifications as they are redundant.	1

1192	Great app.	0
1193	Please enable option to "Pause until I turn it on" or pause for X hours. Now I need to do a force stop through phone settings to close the app. With working from home as the norm, it can be days before I leave the house. Alternatively, allow users to setup a schedule to on and off. Or if the use of GPS is not a privacy issue, detect that the user has left a certain area and switch it on. Google maps now allows a user to specify home location.	2
1194	Installed successfully on Huawei phone without pre-installed Google. Unfortunately, the phone is getting hot and the battery is draining very fast with the app running in background. Definitely need to improve on this.	1

1209	Anyone who thinks this app goes too far and is a government ploy to track you is not thinking about the lives that will be saved. IMO those same people are selfish paranoid jerks.	0
1210	The idea is great but the execution...this has got to be one of the worst government funded apps ever. Terrible for the battery, constant errors, intrusive to a dangerous degree and I don't believe that it's secure with our data. All these resources and THIS is the best they could develop? Hire better coders and have a rethink about how to approach this issue.	0

1223	Quick and easy	0
1224	It needs to run in the background with Bluetooth always turned on leading to high battery usage. For someone who doesn't have a charger or power bank handy, this is very inconvenient. In its current state, the app shouldn't be made the only app for scanning SafeEntry QR codes.	1

1266	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0
1267	Good	0
1268	Bloody Useless. I downloaded day 1 but now uninstalling due to battery/Bluetooth hogging. While I'm happy to do my part, this app just shows how terrible the Aus govt. is in the tech space. Custom built app, understably rushed but not supported, improved or optimised. They need to leverage apps that have actually worked in other countries (like Germany). I also have a sinking suspicion they know it's broken but don't want to say so publicly. Don't bother.	1
1269	Great	0
1270	This app will reduce death and serious disease in the community. Like all apps this has a small privacy risks but, unlike most apps that people don't think twice before downloading, the benefits (good contact tracing) are great and the risks are tiny.	1

1288	What's its use...? Whatever you replied, that point I already got that through Ajay Devgan's Add. But I don't think the tracking is perfect. Also, what about those who don't use Android. Many people who have app don't have location or bluetooth turned on. Also, it will inform us that we were in contact of positive person once it happened. Why government depends on such platform for the tracking which can not be implemented 100%.	1

1309	Okay, it's good, but I absolutely hate the constant notification on the home screen and notification bar. I don't need to know it's working, just work. Get rid of the constant notification	0
1310	The app keeps saying wrong credentials even after I kept logging out and added the mobile number that I provided at the test center. It tells me to log in with some random number. The DHA portal is working fantastically well but this app is giving me issues. I need this problem rectified immediately as I'm a University student and I have my finals on campus coming up soon. If I still have this problem, I wont be able to write my exams. I hope this problem can be solved as soon as possible.	0

1336	First version didn't work on my Oppo. Update worked fine BUT interfered with all my other Bluetooth connections. Everytime CovidSafe would scan, it would cut out other connections. I tried a variety of different settings to fix the problem but nothing helped without disabling CovidSafe. Hence, work calls were abruptly ended constantly when using Bluetooth. This is a huge issue for people working from home. I uninstalled it until this is fixed.	2
1337	I wish I you one stargive covid-19 is not working in my mobile ganda child fix that problem \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f	1

1340	I'm not able to register my Fin number, tried many times still not valid number, very weird	2
1341	Woke up to my phone batter nearly completely drained and overheating. I have had to delete it which is not ideal due to the current climate but the app wouldn't work if my phone is dead when I'm out anyway	1
1342	Nice black theme implementation, I like it! Some of the preliminary text could be condensed and the full counterparts moved into menus though, currently it's long and tedious to read through. Once you're past that, the interface looks intuitive though. Good work!	0

1404	Great idea, but I keep having issues with the battery optimisation on my Oppo Reno Z, even though I've turned my battery optimisation off and given the app full background running permission. If this is going to work it needs to work on all devices.	0

1435	This application is useful and very relevant during this time. The UI is good. However I experienced some crashing whenever I tried to input my passcode, tried to click on Start Scanning the app crashed. Next whenever I opened this system, it takes almost a minute to fully open. Lastly it will be really nice if you have tagalog translation of whole application. Let us all admit that some Filipino can't understand some english terms, make this "pang-masa" so that even ordinary pinoy will use it.	0
1436	Thanks for keeping Australia safe	0
1437	As an international student, I do not have a Singapore number as I'm overseas majority of the time. However, due to the covid-19, I came back to Singspore to be with my family. Is it possible to implement the use of international number of instead of just singapore number?	2
1438	Good One. Congratulations all who works behind this	0
1439	This app has just been updated about 2 minutes ago. Now another feature has just been added- a history containing the number of bluetooth exchanges made each day. I have no idea of why this feature is added but I think it is added to inform users of the number of bluetooth exchanges made each day so that the users will exercise caution in wherever they are and whatever they do.	0

1445	Got a new phone. Huawei p40pro. The OTP part just goes on non-stop. No response from there. Developer response to contact them if there r further issues. I can't even get further than OTP. Will fix it in future versions. I say come out with the next version ASAP. When virus spread, it doesn't wait for next version. Imagine a break in contact tracing just because of an App failure.	2

1447	i live in an area were 10 ppl were confirmed to have covid but in my app there is zero declared cases. the rc143 app shows it.	1

I didn't know what was causing it to be choppy till I deleted this app from my phone and everything is back to normal. I would rather use the token instead.	1

1469	The recent 2.0 update seems to have done something to it's battery use. Judging from the feedback here, I'm not alone in noticing a marked increase in battery drain since the update. In my case, with Covidsafe on, the phone will no longer go on deep sleep/doze. It seems to have borked something with wakelocks. I adopted the app immediately on release and have repeatedly encouraged others to do the same, but in it's present state, I can no longer continue. One kludge I can think of is killing the process when not out and about, but that would require remembering to turn it back on again, which, let's face it, is a losing proposition.	1

1480	Mobile phone is overheating lately due to this app. I have deleted a significant number of other apps or stopped them. This is the only app which I haven't touched and it is making my mobile phone overheat While I do love the concept of this app. I am nervous of how hot my mobile gets especially when a warning of plug out due to excessive heat I had warnings of CPU being overloaded and each time this app was highlighted to me.

Can get the info from Google? Also, if SafeEntry is gong to be mandatory, why there is no SafeEntry app? And, it also implying this app doesn't serve the purpose.	0

1527	Installed easily and no problems initially. One update lost the message an lost auto update. Next (manual from Play store) update needed a permission given again - it stopped working until then. Not sure if it was working with the blank message. Still wrecks bluetooth on iPhones. Badly done and rushed out the door for PR reasons.	2

1548	1 star because the app is messing with my BT headset connection. It drops connection and now my rather expensive headset is unusable. I will wait until 1st August and test it again, if this issue is not fixed, I will unfortunately uninstall this app.	1

1568	App signup was simple enough, though it wouldn't let me paste in my pin number, but there's something that doesn't add up. Location services is claimed to be required for Bluetooth, but I had no trouble giving the app Bluetooth access without location services being enabled. Combined with the refusal to release the source code (as an open source developer myself, I looked forward to reassuring friends and family it was safe), I will not be continuing to use this.	0

1593	Hi I have noticed when i close all apps on my phone and open up again the app is displaying NOT ACTIVE for a few seconds before turning ACTIVE. Is it still running in the background although momentarily saying its not. Thanks. UPDATE. from developer.they are aware of the above glitch but advise IT RUNS in background. 7th Aug.	2
1594	Does it's job, easy and very simple	0
1595	Does what it should, and with a great minimalistic UI. Love that the 'little dev company' has proven the Big Four wrong!	0
1596	Such limited value	2
1597	Installed and opened app, filled in the requested info but it keeps telling me my mobile no. is invalid. So the app is a great idea.......... or would be, if it worked.	2

1607	I started promoting this app to help the government track people easily but it looks like it's being made redundant since they using other means of contact tracing as compulsory soon. I don't know why i bother supporting this app	1

1617	Really lousy. User interface sucks. Asked for OTP but kept failing to validate.	2
1618	Battery drain, unable to use or to update. I social distance all the time. Have mixed view on app, good idea to quell fear in anxious or medically challenged individuals, but not everyone in society has access to this kind of technology, so other methods of semi controlling this virus are more effective. As, regards privacy, I have many concerns, with data harvesting. No, app is a 100pc safe, but, I truly suspect that many will, not use this, due to an invasion of Civil Liberties and non clarity	1

1623	In the last few days my phone has started to freeze up and received notifications relating to high CPU, also had severe battery drain (56% to 0% in space of 2hours - during which phone was not even being used). When checking further, both the Play Services and Covid Tracker app were eating memory. Issue doesnt seem be directly attributed to Covid app, but it relies heavily on Play Services which is the culprit (last update). Clearing the Services cache does help at least!	1

1670	App started rapidly draining battery in a matter of hours since 8 Aug. The only way to stop it was to uninstall Google play services updates and re install them when prompted by the Covid tracker app. Seems to have done the trick.	1

It doesn't work,i called they said they're gonna fix it and gave me a ticket number which i don't know the use of it and it's been 4 days now i'm trying to call for the same reason but in vain.so, my app is not working and can't enter anywhere!!!!!!!!!! Can someone help me plz koz i need to go at least to supermarket	2
1675	Why Can't I install it on my father's phone.It says "this app isn't compitable with your phone" how can i fixed this.	2
1676	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0

1688	0 stars, if only available. They should be more flexible by enabling the web version. The hassle of downloading this app for the sake of entry is time-consuming. Considering that this country has very slow internet connection over wifi	1
1689	Result coming after	1
1690	Not sure that it's working though.	2
1691	Good app. Good intiative. \n\nThere seems to be a bug on the first instance of registering phone number. \n\nError message is “Error verifying phone number. We have blocked all requests from this device due to unusual activity. Please try again later”\n\nClosing the app and reopening resolves this. \n\nPlease note.	0

1693	Since recent "update" this app is no longer giving up-to-date information about the number of covid-19 cases per county (info has not been updated since 30 August) Also, there is no longer a total of cases per county. Instead there is VERY confusing (and INACCURATE) information re the number of cases in past fortnight, the number of cases of cases "today" (30 August) while on another page there is a list of total HOSPITALIZED patients only. Of course this does NOT reflect total no. DIAGNOSED.	1
1694	You should add one option by which we can see our own covid 19 test report also by entering own contact number through otp services verification.you are sending the covid test based sms but if one time phones are formatted then no sms link will be in phone anyway. But if we can see the result in this app that woukd be best for us. Include the service in arogya setu app.	1

1723	Too many problems	1
1724	Don't understand why the app required me to input issue date of NRIC, which meant having to search for the physical card. If you want people to use the app, only collect necessary info for contact tracing. Minimize the steps users must go through for a higher sign up/retention rate.	2

Please fix right away.	2

1747	A good theory, but in practice was far less than perfect. Since activating the app the Bluetooth on my phone keeps turning off automatically after 5-10 minutes, which both negates the usefulness of the app and makes using Bluetooth devices far too impractical. Due to these problems I have decided to remove the app from my phone.	2
1748	Great idea, but cannot complete the setup as i enter the OTP it shows invalid. Please ensure setup process are easy and seamless. It seems still alot of errors.	2

1769	3rd time im reinstalling the app. First time it refuses to let me check in, second time it refuses to let me check out. Both instance i have perfect internet connectivity. Fix the app if you want more people to adopt. And these issues are on top of the battery drain, the disruptions to bluetooth devices connectivity and the spontaneous waking up of device (most irritating in the middle of the night when it detects the other trace together users in my household)	2
1770	Pain in the arse. Runs my battery flat at night so I turn it off. Forget to turn it on when I go out, defeating the whole purpose of having it in the first place. Also hard on the battery using location while running when I'm out and battery goes flat, also defeating the point of having it. I have a high end phone .. God help everyone else ... trying to do the right thing but really???? The QR system is 100 times better.	1
1771	Its not working ...my result didnt even come yet .. my dads and brothers ok it came ..but result only last for 48 hours ... i am waiting for mine ... still shows no result \ud83d\ude11	1

1795	It's so strange why the developers have developed such a simple app that requires ios 13.15 or newer \nAnyone on iPhone 6 or below can not use the app. The government has spend so much money but it would really worth it as more half of the users can not even get it on their phone.	2

1800	From last 2 months, my aap status is showing Covid +ive. This status came up suddently one day, and I have not undergone any prior testing as well. Not sure who maintains this app and how they mark the +ive status on an specifc mobile number. Looks like there is a complete unorganised structure behind, who is maintaining this app and because of that common people are suffering. For me this app is of no use, but is a annoying thing to have.	1

1819	Nowadays the app keep showing "connected to null", "disconnected from null" labels whether using the app or not. After turning off the Bluetooth, these messages disappear. I'm using Samsung phone. Not sure if anyone facing this issue. No such problem in previous versions.	2
1820	Ok	1
1821	App seems to work fine. Had no issues setting up. Doing my bit to help our country get back on its feet, reduce wait for easing the lockdown restrictions, and get people back into employment/work. Together we can reduce the impact that Covid-19 has on all of us.	0
1822	I like the qr scanner. It is very fast and accurate. And also the check out/ check in icon that helped me to remember to check out before checking in. But why is it that i cannot download the latest version, 2.4 that allows multiple check in?	2
1823	Draining pixel 4 battery like crazy. I had to uninstall this after giving lot of thought. You guys really need to take Google and apple existing frameworks to build better apps.	1

1842	Always says something went wrong even though I am registered	2
1843	This is useless app. It doesn't serve any purpose for intelligent persons. It doesn't any sort of sensor. Even if we take the mobile phone and put in the mouth of a Covid'19 patient it doesn't recognize Corona disease. It's only useful for stistical purposes.	1

I believe the tracetogether app consumes alot of power on bluettooth chip and bluetooth chip works 24\u00d77 without stopping , this caused the bluetooth chip broken down. I am not aware that BT chip is broken down and not aware the app has stopped. Please do optimization on the bluetooth function to consume lesser power when it is required to run all time.	2
1857	Battery draining	1
1858	Very very slow and bad	1

1870	Great app indeed! Thank you to all the developers behind this! It really helps a lot to protect me and family.	0
1871	Consume too much baterrei, registration is too complicated, can not stop while at home, the safe entry qr code is much more simpler.	1

1873	Nice spying app \ud83d\udc4d drains battery like nothing else	1
1874	it drain my phone battery fast...phone is hot. it interfierence with bluetooth earpiece, intermittenly leaking/pop sound during use. very poor design app.	1
1875	Awesome app	0
1876	Massive battery consumer, with no added value - had a verified COVID patient at my workplace, same building and floor, got no clue from the app	1
1877	Useful app for combat corona virus in Qatar	0
1878	While out and about on a full working day, with numerous SafeEntry check-ins and check-outs, the app reported ZERO (0) Bluetooth exchanges, even though there were many encounters with others. Surely, it is improbable that all these people are not using TraceTogether. During the day, I had my phone paired via Bluetooth to my smart watch. If I can't use TraceTogether with other Bluetooth devices, then it is not totally unacceptable.	2

1887	Why can't download this App	2
1888	Very good initiative by the Govt but, like other users, I'm also experiencing connectivity issues with my Bluetooth earphones after installing this app. Hopefully this can be fixed soon so that we don't have to choose between leaving the app on or having uninterrupted music!	2

1902	Easy and needed.	0
1903	Waste of batteries. Dont like this at all. Qr code scan already bad enough at most area. Now this. Might as well dont go work.stay at home till all over. I not support anything like this at all.	1

1915	The app should be installed to at least 80-90% of the population to be effective. A better publicity campaign and easier to understand privacy explanations might be helpful.	0
1916	I cant seem to get the otp code after countless tries. Even re-installed it a few times and it still doesnt work.	2
1917	Happy with the premise of the app, but it interrupts the use of my Bluetooth speaker and headphones so I've had o emporsrily uninstall it. Can this be looked into please?	1
1918	This interferes with normal bluetooth operation and causes frequent audio drop outs when listening to music or pod casts, I also suspect it cause other bluetooth issue for my samsung watch.	1
1919	Can't make it work on my Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 pro (Chinese rom). All permissions allowed, Bluetooth on, no battery saver restrictions.	2
1920	App is not working in android phone guys do something ?? everyone need this app .	2
1921	The app is ok I guess, but it took 5 days until it showed up I had contact with a positive case (my brother). Way tooo long. May not be the app, but it took 4 days alone that he got the key to put in the app... Cool idea but not useful if it fails at human again...	2
1922	Good	0
1923	Bad experience. First installation: stopped updating after a number of weeks. Reinstalled it. After 1 month still an unknown risk. Bluetooth is on. Going to reinstall it again now	2
1924	I thought it was running for past 2 months, after what appeared to be successful install but it appears it was not running. May have stopped after last update. Needed "run in background" setting enabled. Hopefully it doesn't kill battery or Bluetooth as per many others experience. Hoping to contribute and also be warned of any proximity to RONA risks.	1

1928	Successfully installed on one phone - all good. Wanted to install on second phone but PlayStore only shows a similar app from the WHO and not this Australian one. There is no choice, just a blue one from the WHO. I do not want anything to do with the corrupt WHO or UN. I wonder how many people download the WHO app by mistake and thereby give their info the WHO. Therefore I although I am very content with the genuine app, I am only giving 1 star to draw attention to what has happened with me. Just realised the android system on the second phone is too old to be able to download the app. The importance of the Android Version number should be made more prominent.	0
1929	Alleged privacy concerns are trivial in the face of our safety and economy. Please encourage others to load.	0
1930	Does what it needs to do but phone battery almost dead after full charge	1
1931	Though its helpful,i cant get the fliping otp! I had to uninstall and reinstall it to get the otp! MOE, can you try to make the app more helpful then i'll give a good review. Plus im a student trying to get the otp!	2
1932	Good	1
1933	I have installed and unistalled numerous times on both my phones and get same message EVERY time..app temporarily not working try again later...this has been same since day 1 of app being avaliable And of course as with all sg customer services they say sorry but give no resolution	2

1945	Great! Works as expected!	0
1946	Happy with the security and privacy of the app but every since the Herald protocol update, it's smashed my battery (Galaxy S10)	1
1947	I'm starting to regret installing this app in the first place; ever since I set up my account, the music I'm listening to via either my Bluetooth earbuds or my BT speaker becomes laggy or gets cut off several times (even if I'm just listening to one song on continuous loop). To top it off, it's literally killing my Samsung Galaxy A8 Star's battery life to the point where I have to recharge it 3 times a day as opposed to only every night previously.	2

1993	Mobile phone is overheating lately due to this app. I have deleted a significant number of other apps or stopped them. This is the only app which I haven't touched and it is making my mobile phone overheat While I do love the concept of this app. I am nervous of how hot my mobile gets especially when a warning of plug out due to excessive heat I had warnings of CPU being overloaded and each time this app was highlighted to me. I want to use this but cannot. Can these issues be fixed?	1
1994	your latest updates got a bug. keeps getting this "connected to Null", then "Disconnected from Null" messages. the messages will appear very often. Tested and confirm to be this app, because the messages stopped appearing once I force stop the app.	2

1997	worst ever	1
1998	Faltu application	1
1999	It’s a useless piece of government surveillance program. I urge you all not to use it as there is evidence that shows that the App does secretly record and store data without your consent.	1
2000	Well designed & intuitive. The additional content is interesting, including the daily statistical updates. So much better than the first app & seems to be much less of a battery suck too.	0
2001	Awesome App	0
2002	App not working	2
2003	I did for free corona test its been more than three days my test is not updated and they dont even have customer care policy	1

2005	good app	0
2006	Great idea in principle, terrible execution. The app constantly stops working and requires you to reopen the app several times a day to work. It also now requires GPS to work which is in contradiction to what has been stated.	0
2007	Good	0
2008	Good but it keeps lagging my bluetooth ear buds. Its very very very annoying. So much so as I'm so very tempted to either uninstall or else i have to keep pausing the app (making the app redundant) every time when I'm connected to my ear buds.	2

2010	It interferes with other apps. Had to uninstall to use other apps.	2
2011	0 star.. So many huawei user complain about tracetogether app, but nothing been work out by the team. Now government force everyone to use tracetogether app, but as huawei user we are force to collect the tracetogether token. The worst is now the collection have been postponed and cause us not able to collect. I urge ur team, please do something on it. Please do not ignore huawei user. This message wil serve as prove to show authority if they check my phone have no install tracetogether app.	2
2012	Unfortunately it breaks Google Play Store on my Samsung Note 10. After installing this app, I can no longer update or install any other apps. I have tested things three times and the result is the same. Please fix.	1
2013	Can’t even sign in. Tells you to enter the code sent to an email, when you come back to the app after checking email, the keyboard disappears! Can’t go forward or back. When trying again, says email is already used even though the registration wasn’t completed! Who developed this??	2

2018	Dear developer. Thanks for your response. I'm using Samsung S10+. With this app, the battery only last me 6/7 hours of a day. My work requires me extensive use of the phone. Hence, I have to carry a battery pack with me wherever I go. As my phone ages, I'm sure the battery power will drain much faster. There is no point for this app if users phone batteries cannot last the whole time that they are out and about. Not sure about the privacy portion....	1

2044	Why not have a sign in button when people got to Venues such as restruants as a digital sign. And have the the Maitre D or someone from the venue witness the customer signing in. That way it won't breach the Privacy ACT as opposed to the current system implemented	1

2072	Location madatory? Until the last update the app was active as long as bluetooth was enabled. Now it requres the location to be enabled as well. Is this a deviation from the initial design? Is this a breach of trust? People installed the app because the govt assured that people will not be stalked.	2

2081	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0
2082	I stayed at home the whole day but can still get 95 exchanges with other trace users!? Even if my family is at home, the number should not be this high. Is the bluetooth range so wide that perhaps it can detect my neighbour's?	1
2083	Interrupts my music	1
2084	While I do understand the purpose of using my location and Bluetooth, I do have a concern about accessing my storage specially that installing the application is mandatory by law.	1
2085	Very bad	1
2086	Useful app, everybody should use it. I read many reviews about this app draining the battery. I've been using it for almost a month and have had no such issue.	0
2087	Love the app! Can you not integrate it with restaurants so that we don't have to write our info at each place if we have the app?	0
2088	App not optimised. Affect phone performance such as causing lag and causing breakage in bluetooth earphone music. Poorly developed.	2
2089	Bluetooth keeps disconnecting with other devices since the app is running in the background all the time. Please fix this.	2
2090	Nice and simple, does basically what it should. The only two minor omissions I see are: 1 An ability to set a reminder notification to occur at some time each day if I forget to check in. 2 An ability to provide feedback from the app. Those omissions are forgivable when the idea is to keep the app simple.	0
2091	Was ok, until updated. Now drains my battery too quickly. Uninstalled. Don't bother people	1

2093	Scanner not active. Better to use singpass	2

2107	It really zaps the battery like crazy... coupled with the bt issue that I've read about (which I have not experienced yet). I honestly think this is a fail, am going to uninstall and wait till the product improves and you wonder why the take up rate is less than expected. This is meant to aid in the tracing efforts with minimum inconvenience to the user. Batt and BT, these are the most basic needs of most smart phone users. Please improve on this asap.	1

2129	The idea good but the implementation need to be improved, the app keep send notification every hour for the same idea and Everytime you clear the notification you will receive the notification again.	0
2130	Make it available also in english. Tak!	2
2131	I have an updated new iPhone XR, it’s updated with new versions. I have downloaded, and it won’t enable. I have all the settings on correctly. I have contacted apple for support and they have identified it’s not the phone but a problem with the app Itself. I have deleted the app and reinstalled many times and yet you fine folks tell me to now delete app shut off my phone THEN reinstall. I’ve done all of that and IT STIIL DOESNT WORK. A waste of time. I would like to be notified if I’ve been exposed, but this app doesn’t cut it. Just FIX it! Or heck give me a number to call and WORK with me to actually figure it out. Come on guys! You are suppose to be the smart ones. cheers!	2

2135	Covid tracker in this app is just a job in which bing news r added without purpose. You should add locations of those areas in which tests r being conducting or area under observation so that area wise graphs can represent with pure local news instead of adding bing chennel	2
2136	Until the recent update this app was okay a few gripes mentioned below. Unfortunately It now eats my battery and caused my Bluetooth headphones to be completely out of sync with video! I am going to uninstall it until we get the second wave in Tassie! I also really don't like the permanent icon and status in my notifications bar. Please make this app so that it only notifies me if there is a problem!!!!!!!!	1

2146	Redmi note 8 pro not working after updated anyone knows how to resolve this issue so please let me know	2
2147	Works great, but you should really add language selection. Not everyone wants to use the language their phone is set to. Also, my friend who lives in Helsinki cannot download the app because he has a Canadian Google Play account. Maybe make the app available to everyone? There are a number of foreign people living in Finland who can't or don't want to use the Finnish Google Play.	0
2148	It's not working with my Samsung A30s. It's only showing the previous status when I visit to public places like dwar or super market its should show the updated version not the same one. Whenever I open this app it show the update from the date I installed this app. Please look in this matter.	2
2149	The app Keeps crashing when it the activation button is clicked. It serves only as a movement certificate generator	2

2151	The app is super laggy. Literately my friends not using trace together scan 5 seconds done. Than me here with trace together wait 1min for the camera to load. Smh.	2

2170	I don't mind using this app, I'm actually quite happy to help. But I constantly have issues with my other Bluetooth devices... My watch desynchronise every couple of minutes and when I'm playing music in my car either the music stop and restart every 10 sec or even completely stops... I had to deinstall it to solve the problem	0
2171	Great idea.... Hopefully everyone gets on board	0
2172	Ok	0
2173	Not sure if it's me only but the app is causing interference to the proximity sensor to malfunction when i have incoming calls. Phone screen will auto blank out whenever incoming calls are picked up and hence cannot end call or access number pad or turn on speaker mode at all. Because of this i have to uninstall this app until the issue is fixed. I'm using Google Pixel 3A XL. Thanks.	2
2174	Facing the same issue as other users as well. Thought my wireless earbuds has started to be faulty but once I saw the reviews it was actually this app interrupting the bluetooth connection, making my music I am listening to stop for a split second sometimes. Hope something is being done to fix this if Singapore is pushing for more people to use TraceTogether. :)	2

2226	Couldn't download. Said mobile number invalid	2
2227	I am not sure if this app works but it definitely drains battery using Bluetooth. Requesting below updates for better performance: 1. Use location services to let user define home location. 2. If users are at home then Bluetooth and other app functions can take a break and give phone battery some rest. 3. Let users know if there are any active covid19 patients or potential patient who is advised for strict home quarantine in the vicinity of 100 meters.	1

2248	White screen instead of results same as the other review below. Worked till yesterday but now when you need it most, it doesn't. 12-07 Update: I wrote an email to the address on the leaflet we got upon arrival at the airport and got a reply with the (negative) test results back within 30 minutes. 14-07 Update: Still got the white screen after update. 24-07 Update: I can finally see the results!

2251	I tried installing it several times thinking that they were unsuccessful, until I finally gave up. On the last install, thinking it was still unsuccessful, I left it on the phone and went to sleep... suddenly the next morning, I found that it was successfully installed. Perhaps something could be done about the problem, so that more people would install this Apps on their phone.	2
2252	It's good that's all	0
2253	I doubt anyone who has COVID would actually report it to this app and if u did have COVID and u went out in public, it’s probably so u can get other people sick. This app just doesn’t work	1

2256	Not suite for my phone redmi 8. And also taking more time to give result.	2
2257	Finally got it working, after countless times of trial and error. Hopefully it can detect what error exactly. Hate guessing game.	2
2258	Had no issues with this app EXCEPT that only 25% of the population uses it so what is the point. Probably should have been pushed out to all active mobiles by the Govt, like bushfire warning and the like. Have now uninstalled it as do not come into contact with many people these days and my location has no active cases.	2
2259	Downloaded the app today and unable to even open it. It just shows the screen with the app name. Nothing further happens. It's a requirement by UAE and I have my flight in a few days. Please fix the app.	1

2297	I have iPhone XR & have been using this app since the day Quebec officially asked everyone to use it. So far no complaints but the latest app update is drowning the battery life like crazy. The app used 20% battery life in 6 hrs. I uninstalled it to verify that it’s this app & guess what I was right. Developers please fix this if you want people to use it. Thanks	1
2298	Is a good start for creating this app. However this app force my screen brightness to 0% even I turn off adaptive brightness and manual adjust the brightness to 60%. Is there a way to get around this issue?	2
2299	Very poor .Turning the Bluetooth on all the time drains battery too quickly. Additionally, it makes one very much likely to be infected by malware.	0
2300	It keeps dropping of.	2
2301	Look it very simple. Install it. Allow it. if you have been in close contact with a confirmed case you will be contacted. It won't let let you know the person and you may not know them. Also you won't get informed if you just passed them. It works on Bluetooth, so on a 30min train with someone infected yes get message. Driving pass them = no. Down load it. Help this problem go ASAP.	0

2329	Working fine and as expected.	0
2330	What started out well has gone in the wrong direction. Can't even register now - keeps saying wrong OTP. Tedious to set up and intrusive, asks for IC date of issue (for what? Not necessary until I've been exposed.) On top of all this I ask myself why I even bother, when this app won't work properly on my friends' iPhones and they've all refused to use it. To Govt and GovTech... can you PLEASE just make use of the Apple/Google COVID-19 framework which is a much more efficient solution.	2
2331	A ten character password is required when all data will be held on the users phone. This is silly and excessive. Should be 8 characters like every other pass word I own	1
2332	I just received the notification that I have been exposed within the past 14 days. \nFirst of all - why is it telling me this now rather than informing me that a positive person is around me at the moment when I can be prepared to move away to prevent a spread. Instead it messages me when I’m at home alone that I’m exposed hours later and been around vulnerable family members in the meantime. \n\nSecond of all - there’s no way of knowing my location at the time of exposure. I understand this could prevent identity issues. However, it’s important that I know where I was at the time to trace my steps. \n\nThis app can be much better to prevent the spread. Don’t wait to inform the people. Give constant updates that we’re safe or need to get out of an area. Otherwise this app is just not useful if my only information is “you’ve been exposed”. Needs to be better.	1

2406	Excellent	0
2407	Excellent app with detailed information.	0
2408	Bad	1
2409	Extremely battery-draining because this app requires Mobile-Data or Wifi, plus Bluetooth AND GPS location to be switched on simultaneously at all times, plus it MUST run in the background without limiting its usage of background system resources.	1
2410	Downloaded, cannot register as apparently my phone number of the past 20 years is invalid. And yes I dropped the 0. No troubleshooting, no help for this. Can't be the only one.	2

2419	Apart from using your phones battery, I don't know what else this app is good for? It hasn't proven to be helpful in tracking any contacts that human contact tracers haven't found.	1
2420	The app is very essential to every Bangladeshi. Proverb says, prevention is better than cure. Further to say,	0
2421	Ok but since installation my phone is turning to airplane mode on its own, frequently	1
2422	OTP never came to my phone, there is no option to resend OTP or email it. And where to report if OTP is not working? There is no HELP section or Report problem section on the app or website. I couldn't register. Please look in to this matter. Appreciate the effort. Thanks	2

2436	App allow be installe only in BG segment of appstore. But after start app offers to change the language bg/eng. So, if somebody prefer eng then this person can’t install the app on previous step.	2
2437	This CovidSafe tokenisation should be integrated with businesses that need to keep customers information , a quick QR scan and verification message/ sound that the location /business is recorded. Instead of having to (mis)enter your details each time manually/handwritten or mistakenly deliberately because people don't want to leave their details everywhere	1
2438	better to be safe then sorry	0
2439	Can't receive OTP, I tried thru App and website, no use, pls fix it.	2
2440	Had the app installed since early July. In the last week my new phone was being drained with battery power and would have to charge it twice a day. Along with that the screen would heat up, this really annoyed me so I got rid of the app off my phone and immediately the battery power improved. I will not use this app again until I know for certain that it will not harm my phone and that the proof is shown that these major problems have been resolved completely.	1

2469	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0
2470	After I install the app I cannot open the app when I open it closes on itself please help I cannot go out without this. Please help	2

2480	The app doesn't work. Keeps on popping up a message that user credentials national ID and DoB isn't correct.	2
2481	I think this app is causing bad connection for my bluetooth ear pcs to my hp. Having bad connection ever since I installed. With the latest update,is getting even worse!	2

2491	Why I can't download EHTERAZ??	2
2492	Easy to install, hopefully we never need it. However feeling safer already. Now we need everyone to install it!!!	0
2493	The app does not even open for me. It just says that EHTERAZ keeps stopping. I have tried turning on my location, my bluetooth but it is still not opening. If the app does not open there is no point of having it.	2
2494	Please install and register. It is simple and easy. For this to work as it is supposed, we need to do it all together !!	0

2496	Battery drained on android.	1
2497	Great app	0
2498	Great idea. I'd hope anyone with concerns is unable to read this as they shouldn't be online at all. If they are then they should make themself useful to their fellow Australians and get this app so we can get out of iso sooner.	0

2504	App sometimes unable to load	2
2505	Great idea but terrible implementation. Runs constantly in the background with no way to turn it off when you are just at home and don't need it, only option is to uninstall. By default has a persistent notification to tell you whether it's working which is annoying.	0
2506	Very poor application . Full of errors. You do everything right still you can not login and there is delay for work permit upload though I am HCW	1
2507	Good	0

2532	OK	0
2533	So bad application	1
2534	Please ask telecom operators to send notifications to all users to download and install the app. Wide spread usage is required to get the full benefits. \n\nSupermarkets  may be instructed to let in customers with smartphones to have this app mandatorily. This can be applied to any places where many people may be together (hospital, buses). Most of the people would have smartphones. Atleast you can enforce on people with smartphones.	0

2562	Radius Area didn't open or it took a lot of time. Kindly fix this problem.	1
2563	This should be given a negative star.

2612	I\u2019m a sceptic when it comes to government apps but I read the Privacy Policy and felt reassured that I could use a fake name, only asked for my age range, postcode and phone number. I was reassured my location is not tracked or recorded and it\u2019s deleted every 21 days. The app only works on Bluetooth signal strength vicinity to record distance from potential infected people. Reassured and feel like I\u2019m doing my bit for my friends, family and country co I can be contacted ASAP if I came close to anyone who ends up infected.  Brilliant bit or technology actually. I turn off at night when I\u2019m sleeping into \u2018Airplane Mode\u2019 so it not emitting signals while I sleep.    If you\u2019re an Aussie and care you\u2019d download it too and delete this app in a month or so when this all blows over!  \ud83d\ude1c\ud83c\udf7b	1

2628	Worked fine until this weekend. Suddenly started draining my phone battery. Normally my battery lasts 2 days. It now lasts barely 6 hours. Phone is becoming super hot too. Trouble shooted this by turning on developer options on phone. Wiped cache and also wiped cache on Google play store. Uninstalled and reinstalled apps that were recently updated. Discovered this app is to blame. Once uninstalled phone returned to normal operation and battery life. A fix is urgently needed	1
2629	Why should this app needs access to my file, media and photo on this mobile. Hopefully location should be enough for this app	1
2630	Excellent! Should be mandatory for all civil servants, uniformed services, transport services, delivery service personnel and all of thier families. Coverage is key to the success of this effort!	0

2640	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0

2642	Excellent	0
2643	Good system	0
2644	Poor	1
2645	The app should inform you that you will not be notified of close contact unless you open App. It happened recently to a friend. When she opened App she was told she had been in close contact with a confirmed case 5 days previously. She was contascted by the HSE shortly afterwards. One of my other friends tells me she receives a notification each week to confirm she has not had any close contacts. I do not receive this message. Should the app not be consistent for all users?	1
2646	Works well, not intrusive, updates automatically. Does what it's supposed to do. Plus, a nice place to see simple relevant statistics on Covid in Belgium	0

2649	Battery drain off too fast with the apps kept running in the background. After installation, wordings are not completely being seen, cover by the button "next". Therefore it is apparently useless to me.	1
2650	Good app to start with. But then ah, possibly could enlarge, bold and/or highlight the location/shop name when checked in for the TT people to see. Not sure is it due to different phone screen size, the wording kind of slim/small (could be due to the background image used). P.s Using Samsung S20+ Thanks.	0

If I am able to use the barcode at a small Fairprice outlet at Compassvale Link, why can't a big mall like Compass One do it. The guy at the entry point told me to use SingPass mobile, I went into the app to find safe check-in location, I can't even locate Compass One!	2

2664	Drained my battery to zero after using from 10 am to 5 pm. So changing to 3 star rating. Only 1 step to scan QR code for check in. And check out from your app- no need to scan again. PLUS save your frequent visited location under FAVORITES and just tap for immediate check in. No need to look for QR code at the location. SUPER - group check in for family. No need to scan one by 1.

2675	The Australia logo with the tick still appears in the status bar when Bluetooth is off, although the detailed text in the notification tray changes. Maybe a different icon to indicate that the app is not active would be easier to alert that the app needs to be checked?	1
2676	Who created this app? Any testing done? Keyed in correct nric but kept coming back saying nric number validation failed? Hellooo....	2
2677	I app is very good app that help me	0
2678	Great App! To all those that are concerned about the location permission: The use of "Bluetooth Low Energy" is strictly tied to the location permission in android. That does not mean that the app uses GPS! The code is open source. If anything fishy would be going on, people would have noticed.	0
2679	Amazing app Woundrful UI	0
2680	I cannot open the app. Multiple times I uninstalled then install again the app but same thing happens. It keeps crashing.	2
2681	It's spy application, if you install this app, the government will know everything about you, places where you going etc.etc. and Babiš too.	1
2682	Nice	0
2683	Can't able to log in with my work permit fin number and name is showing wrong always why like this can reply me please	2
2684	Apart from occasional bugs (cannot check out) I hope they will improve on the followings from user experience:\n\n1) the home screen takes up half of the screen space and won’t scroll away. It also doesn’t offer any useful info apart from showing an image of three persons with active mobile phones. \n\n2) home screen should display a list of all checked-in places, instead of showing just the latest one. This allows users to see at once where have they not checked out yet instead of having to check out one by one.  We really have no time for this especially when our hands are occupied with heavy groceries.	2
2685	Great initiative by the govt!	0
2686	Very Good app.. Please update more.	0
2687	The latest update is unstable (frequently hanging) and also no longer shows how many days have past since the last testing date. With the previous version, the user/inspector can easily see how many days have passed since the last COVID19 test. In latest version, if you access the result after some time (4 days in my experience) it will just say "Negative - Expired". In the previous version, it would say "Negative for 4 days"..	1
2688	This should be mandatory for anyone in Singapore to have on their phone! Nice to see technology being useful for this outbreak!	0

2698	After 20 hours feels like it drains battery a bit, but otherwise looks clean and works as advertised.	1
2699	App is perfectly safe, and doesn't request any permissions. It's important that we use this now, to keep on top of the virus.	0
2700	Useless	1
2701	Perfect	0
2702	Overall I'm impressed with the app. Simple to use and good design as well! However, it does drain my battery a little, but I'm fine with it, after all the app is protecting me from Covid. Perhaps u could add in dark mode for the app as well, just a suggestion. Otherwise all is good with the app!! \u263a\ufe0f	0

2706	Draining my phone battery. I heard they are working on a solution, something to do with PlayStore. Anyone heard anything?	1
2707	Doesn't drain battery, faster than usual anyway have not noticed it causing any additional issues that I can attribute to this app. Stays on all the time. Have never had to restart.	1
2708	Nice	0
2709	Fine until it left my phone dead every 20 mns so i had to uninstall the app	1
2710	A breakdown in numbers per town would sharpen attention. The app is more like a screenshot of a Web page - nothing very illuminating. How often has the contact tracing element been used? Battery draining was a real problem. Reinstalled now. Let's see.	1
2711	Good	0
2712	As all the other reviews, I've had the same issue since I arrived on the 2nd of November. Was able to check only once and that was it, I receive the notification and when I enter to check in it says "no check in required"	2

2719	Unable to re-install this app. After removing this app I'm trying to install this app, but still it is not getting install.	2
2720	It isn't working for new updates	1
2721	The app told me of a possible match of an infected person in Pasta Basta in Ramat Gan where Iwas supposed to have been. When I ask to show this location on the map and open it, the map shows a wrong location as I know for a fact that there is no Pasta Basta in that location. The developers need to add a way for individuals to edit and correct location or at least to mention that the place mentioned does not exist there.	1
2722	Once dnld, hp become slow, prompted low memory, battery dropped faster its ran background non stop n we cannot stop it only can pause, but it still consumed battery backend! unless use force stop in app manager. Please make it can stop or exit Apps once not in use!	1

2737	It's draining my battery	1
2738	This app could save my life. I'm more than happy to let others have a record of having come into contact with me if they become ill with COVID-19. If I get sick then others can be informed if they have been in contact with me. Not being able to tell other people I'm sick won't be on my conscience. This is a lot less data than we surrender to Facebook, Google etc. on a daily basis.	0
2739	Phone killer App It took 20% battery in one hr So i blocked the app to deal with battery It still slows the phone to a level that will be smashed on the wall!!!! No thanks i prefer Magen 1 App deleted as is not suited for older phones and it kills the phone Talk to me on magen 3 i am very sory i was convinced to remove Magen 1	1
2740	Good little app, great to see it rolled out. I have struggled to get the QR code’s to scan at some premises, they come up as invalid and I am then using my phone camera which takes me to another site. Would be good to manually be able to enter details into the app without requiring a at code so we don’t have to scan other codes.	0

2760	Was stuck at the mobile number verification stage but then I 1. Dropped the 0 at the start of my phone number and 2. Turned off Wi-Fi It immediately worked. This should be written into the app, otherwise too many frustrated people will ditch it. Developers need to ensure the process is easy for everyone.	2
2761	How can this app be using more than 41% of my phone's battery??? This is ridiculous	2

2838	Great app! \nYou should add an in-app share button, the app would spread faster than covid.	0
2839	Please add daily statistics (last 24 hours) to the app too. Users will like to open the app on a daily basis to see a dynamic of the spreading. As it is now, with an aggregated statistics, it is not informative on the virus dynamic. So, very often, I (and I guess many others) don't open the app for few days as current aggregated statistics is not interesting.	2

2865	EDIT: you need to have mobile data on (instesd of just wifi) for the app to confirm and accept your mobile number. ORIGINAL: Can't get beyond the 'invalid phone number' message. I know my phone number is not invalid, yet it won't tell me what is wrong with my number or how I am entering it. I want to do the right thing, but the difficulty I am experiencing in trying to do this is quite dissuading.	1

The Italian version does NOT require the phone #, neither the GPS. 1 GPS always on = battery drain; if it's not needed as claimed then don't ask for it! 2 If you adv that you don't take the data but then you ask my #, it's just a matter of "safety reasons" that my ID+gps will be released to police	1
2902	Poor	1
2903	37 ? I think it would be better if there was a map showing nearby corona infected people by marking their location with a label of distance from mine. And I hope every possible person using a smartphone will use this app and help each other to know and safe us from corona. Thanks Corona Tracer BD Team	2
2904	I can't open the app. It's stopped working for no reason. It is not working	2

2910	The app is good and easy to use jnnut get rid of the permanent notification! It's so annoying always being there and the only way to get rid of it is to turn off notifications, but that ruins the point of the app. With notifications off I can't get notifications if I have been near someone with Covid-19, but I hate the notification! 5 stars if they get rid of it.	0

2954	It's not an app. It's just info from their website. No alerts will work. Read the small print here. Country was to lazy to try and test everyone. You input data yourself. Tax payers money. O yea this is Google's app	0
2955	I find it is not working at all I keep my phone on 24/7 and no notifications at all. \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20 So this app is a useless app.\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20.

2956	I don't have any experience yet. But 5 stars for the great app. The app lets users to use one mobile numbers on multiple devices that I had come across on the 26 of April. I don't know it still allows multiple users for a same number.	0

2961	Just to let you know, this application really used to work perfect for me and I even gave it 5stars until the latest update after which whenever i launched this application, it closes instantly by displaying a message that "Covid-19 keeps on stopping".

2985	I received the code to alert others only 18h after my positive test result. That's too slow. I understand precautions, but the labs managing the codes seems safe enough and much faster. We can afford a few false positives much better than the delays at the moment. And: no way to copy paste the 9 digit code? C'mon!	2
2986	Good	0
2987	If it keep people safe why not. I wouldn't be worried about tracking. There alot of other app that do this more eg google, what app, facebook etc.. with here own hidden agenda's.	0
2988	A great idea, but mine doesn\u2019t send me notifications when it\u2019s off (it used to) and you never hear any info in the media about whether it has actually been successful in tracking any cases. The take-up has been poor, hampered by tech and security issues, and I have no real confidence in it but use it anyway.	2
2989	I thanks u qatar govt for this app .my message .stay home safe home because someone waiting for u at home thx	0
2990	I think it is a great idea.. But it's need positive response from everyone.	0
2991	Can't even log in the app...It says its temporarily unavailable.Waste of space	2
2992	Excellent	0
2993	This app collects less data than Facebook, and at least it is being put to good use. It is also interesting to see the progress which we have made fighting the virus. At the time of writing 560,000 people have downloaded this app.	0
2994	Unable to register with my NRIC. The app stated validation failed.	2
2995	It's won't let me join, it says my phone number is invalid.? Have deleted the app restarted my phone and still can't join. If anyone can help that would be great.	2

2998	It should have the date of report received , instead of date of testing, we are at loss in this feature, please refer ph app ajman	1
2999	Not able to download the app at all!	2
3000	Useless apps	1
3001	For anyone still receiving an invalid phone number error message, try restarting your phone after downloading the App. This worked for me after a few frustrating minutes of trying to set it up. Don't forget to omit the zero when entering your mobile number.	2
3002	No option to turn off app. (For times when i am at home) Needs better integration (Still need to do safe entry although this app can track me ) Drains battery too fast.With so many issues it is hard to have huge usage for such an important app *Update* App improves with safe entry scanning, ability to pause	1
3003	I think it's a winner!	0
3004	Unuseful app.. my mobile number was registered with different number. It was saying that my credentials were incorrect while i used only 1 number since i live here. There are no contact number to correct this as well.	1
3005	29.7% of my battery usage today. Basically had to recharge at lunchtime to make it through the day. Really WANT to have this on my phone but it's killing it.	1
3006	Good	0
3007	Installed but there is a constant notification on which can't be disabled - ideally it should run in the background. And no additional information unlike similar apps being used in other countries with detailed hotspot/transmission information visible on map, to avoid such place or area. Very basic.	1
3008	Good	0
3009	Why make this app when u18s cant use it. There has been multiple spikes of people from as young as 15 yet they wont be able to register	2
3010	Confirmation code not came on time requested.	2
3011	Cant even go beyond registration..	2
3012	When I set up the account, the message "Temporarily not available, please try again later" pops up every time. I have already tried installing and uninstalling but it still stays the same. Please work on it. Thanks.	2

3019	Has absolutely destroyed the battery life on my phone even after deleting it. Afraid it's malware or something.	1
3020	It started lagging a few days after I downloaded it, also it drained my phones battery.	1

3033	The Data collected is encrypted and will only be stored on your phone and the other COVIDSafe User's Phone *clicks next* "Information about your use of COVIDSafe will be collected and stored on a highly secure server" "You may also ask for your information to be deleted from the secure server" Also given what i've read this app will be useless regardless since it only tracks if you are within 1.5m of someone for 15 minutes, which doesn't track who you really transfered Covid-19 to at all.	2
3034	PROPOSAL: CP App is very useful but government should educate to the citizens regarding this system and a citizen service center must be work in every city of Pakistan so that complainants may be send thier allocations properly because helping counter na honay ki waja se peoples complaints kartay he nahi.	2

3051	Not even opening for me. Stuck in the launch screen	0
3052	What kind of an app is this? The app is continuously stopping, I even tried factory reset to install the app. Still the same.tried calling 109, they don't even answer. Can someone set this right? Changing my review: Finally got a very helpful person on 109 who helped me sort it out. Try requesting the OTP over mobile data instead of WiFi, remove any VPN on the mobile. Changed the rating as they are resolving the teething problems.	2
3053	I have received the test result but in the app it doesn't show the result. Can any one helo me?	2
3054	Why does it keep stopping? I support the use of this app, but it keeps stopping. Even though battery optimisation is on in my settings, the app keeps requesting I turn optimisation on. After being out for 4 hours yesterday, I found that the app wasn't activated because it had turned itself off. Now if I was in contact with anyone who is diagnosed with covid-19 I'll never know.	1
3055	It shows only last test report but still better than seha app	1
3056	Continues to say invalid phone phone number	2
3057	Optimize the app, it drains the battery too fast. If not solve this people going to stop using after few days.	1

3061	Great initiative. But it is interfering with my bluetooth headset's audio connection. I'm losing audio for a couple of seconds in every 10-15 secs. After 3 months, still the same issue. This interferes with my Bluetooth audio connection.	0
3062	Third class	1
3063	Battery killer	1
3064	Works fine. Easy install, but an example of what the requested mobile phone number should look like when the +61 prefix is showing would help those who don't know not to include the starting zero of their mobile number. Don't forget to use the friends invite at the end of the install.	0
3065	Mobile number validation now accepting .y number and giving invalid number error.	2
3066	I believe that the app will be inefficient. For example I don't carry my phone everywhere I go but no doubt the headmaster mentality of government will in the future impose punishment in some form to make all fall into line . It is dangerous to continually break the spirit of the Australian people . I have down loaded this app to reduce the impact on our economy and for no other reason. All hail scomo .	1

3077	App is good and now, with the inclusion of the barcode scan inside, however, some malls are not accepting this barcode and insist on a physical IC or QR safe entry scan, example Northpoint. It used to accept this barcode scan using this app but now, cannot already. If this mall and others do not accept, then what is the point of adding? \ud83d\ude2d	2

3085	Thanks for your help	0
3086	There's no instructions, no explanations, the ToS you have to accept, but can't read it. The battery is drained insanely fast, meaning i have to have my phone fully charged before going outside; not to mention that it slowly kills the phone in this way. And to top it all off, it requires access to photos and calls, which makes no sense at all or it won't start - people are spending money and waiting in queues just to get burner phones to protect their privacy. Is anybody looking into this issue?	1
3087	I first installed on my Huawei note. After installation and started using, I realised it blocked off all other Bluetooth usage. Bought a new Huawei phone with no Playstore, how to install the App.	2
3088	Absolute waste of time downloading wants to use location instead of Bluetooth after updating, not only that but not even ONE repeat ONE case has been detected by this app	1
3089	Ok	0
3090	What a positive surprise! Easy to install and understand. Simple and sleek interface. Based on one day usage does not drain the battery. Requires location services (no GPS) to be on so that other devices can be scanned but does NOT use GPS or any other location data. Releasing without English was a mistake and language selection should be available. Other than that this feels like a well done app. Extra points from open source release!	0

3119	Installed - "GPS must be always on" - deleted it. Claiming privacy first, but requiring GPS to be on to work in combination with Internet access is not privacy. Big Brother / Google - type of privacy is a no go. Btw, for BLE device scan you could have used: "Bluetooth.Adapter.getDefaultAdapter().startDiscovery()" to avoid need for GPS, but you didn't, so it's a conscious choice to violate privacy principles.	2
3120	Downloaded then it puts a symbol by your battery. Uninstalled symbol still there.\nCan not get the tracking component off your phone.	1
3121	5th June 2020, unable to install TraceTogether, as i am unable to receive the OTP password and unable to complete the installation. to troubleshoot, I had uninstalled and reinstalled TraceTogether but the mobile app (version 2.0.1) is not working.\n\n20200605 , Had tested with WhatsApp mobile app, uninstalled and reinstalled the program and WhatsApp is working perfectly fine\n\nI am using IOS version 13.5.1	2

3147	Doesn't tell if it's running or not. The BT batt consumption maybe improved due to change in underlying tech and I assume the changes in the way it works is because of Google requirments. But the app design doesn't show if it's active on background. On android 9 and up there is Google notification when Bluetooth is off. That's how to test if app running. On Android 6,7,8 ..NO such notification. Also NO system log showing any sort of activity as it was in vers1. Chinese phones kill Google Apps.	1
3148	I'm all for the COVID Tracker Ireland app and all our family have it up and running. One concern with the included optional phone number input. There is no apparent function to verify the number I input is actually from the phone in use! I could technically add anyone's phone number. This could have a knock on effect as there is a minority out there who like to mess things up for the majority. Just a thought!	0

3164	Ei tööta huawei telefonis. Nõuab Google play uuemat versiooni. Paraku tehnilistel põhjustel ei saa ma seda uuendada kuna siis kaotaksin ka selle vähese ligipääsu Google teenustele mis uue huawei omanikul on. Võibolla on võimalik teha sellest versioon huawei store'i või hoida vähem sõltuvad ühe konotstiumi teenustest. Teine tärn selle eest, et teistel on sellest apist abi. Parimat. MK	2
3165	Totally can't work with my Huawei P30 Pro. can't even download. but I go to playstore, already say that I installed. but I can't even see the apps at all.	2
3166	Ever since I updated the apps and the logo change to red color ( from blue) I can never get pass the NRIC validation. It is as though the apps know my ID better than me who had been using it for 40 years? \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 What a ridiculous and unreliable update. 15th Sept Register success after a update on the app.	2
3167	Requires a photo or video. Intrusive and no good for anyone with even mild Scopohobia. Deleted.	2
3168	I always thought this application design could be really helpful so I yet don't understand what was the core problem with previous version and what has changed now. Anyway I miss the collected data table. This transparency behind actual functionality of the application was really nice so why did you removed it? Thumbs up for the news tab, on point.	0

3173	As long as this helps our safety than this is a great app.	0
3174	I cannot set my home location as the app has specified the radius of location. My apartment is outside the given radius. Please help! What can I do? No edit button!	2

3183	After every IOS update application lose registration - you need to enter phone again. What is the reason this happen?	2
3184	5 attempts to get past Invalid Phone Number screen. Unsuccessful. It is my correct phone number. So no pin sent and unable to activate	2
3185	Great idea and extremely safe	0
3186	Everytime I try to open it, it's closed immediately. Whenever I need the information from this apps, I should uninstall and reinstall again and all over again :( so sad	2

3203	Destroys battery life. Ever since Kildare, Offaly and Laois went back into lockdown, the app constantly runs in the background. It caused my brand new Samsung S20 to go from 100% to 0% in 4 hours. I would usually only charge the phone once every 2 days.	1

3210	While the purpose of this app is great it sucks the life out of my battery. I have an up to date phone and have nothing else running in the background like this app. I think I'll stick to what I've been doing.	1

3261	Now you require my location. This was my biggest fear about downloading the app. I need to protect my whereabouts. So you have made this app useless to me. Uninstalling!	1
3262	Latest version always stuck at registration page dispite keying in all the data as per my ic. Useless.	2
3263	Wow	0
3264	Well its difficult to rate an app that doesnt do anything... I guess in this case, if you don't notice anything special means it's great...	2
3265	I appreciate the value of what this app has to offer in regards to COVID-19. But this app drains my battery overnight. I’m assuming it’s been pinging my husbands phone while I’m sleeping. It’s on charge all night and I wake up to low power. Please address this.	1
3266	Excellent	0
3267	I understand it's purpose but it drains your phone's battery so fast that it's become an annoyance. It needs a 'home' option so that it isn't constantly searching for other's with the app and killing battery life.	1
3268	No need of it	1
3269	the app tells me that my number is not correct or registered.. the number for support doesn't work	2
3270	It drains your battery because it needs Bluetooth etc to work. Plus it has a notification displayed all day everyday.	1
3271	Perfect	0
3272	Keep crashing bluetooth app (user might experience this as bluetooth app rebooting), resulting in frequent reconnections to other bluetooth devices. Fix it or you will see more pp force stop the app after checking in, defeating the purpose of contact tracing.	2

3279	I enjoy the updates regarding the scanning of the qr code,now it automatically check in once we scanned the code which to me makes sense than being asked to confirm if we want to check in. And the speed of the scan is very satisfying to me, most of the time it can get the qr code before i can aim. The one improvement in my mind is maybe can increase the size of check in and check out. The "Scan QR" and "check out" so i can tap it easier than what it is now.	0

3285	I am not sure if the app is functioning as intended since the main screen always shows “ last checked one minute ago” .\nPlease advise.I give 3 star because some sort of lack understanding - although it is meant to be simple , not sure about its operational status and reliability	1

3298	Really annoyed, I turn on my battery optimisation But everytime I lock my phone while I'm out it turns the battery optimisation off again so it doesn't work until I check it again and turn back on. And then it repeats again. Literally no help what so ever \ud83d\udc81 I've deleted it. Pointless	1
3299	The idea behind this app is good in order to track down on who's infected and who's not, but this app is an invasion of privacy when it forces to keep Location and Bluetooth ON at all times so they can track your location whereever you are and know when you are moving where and to and how long you have been anywhere, this is the reason why battery drains fast. Totally unacceptable. There is no law in the world that forces anybody to install an app that invades our privacy on our personal phones!	0
3300	Very easy to sign up to and happy to participate.	0
3301	Unable to save personal profile in latest update. Cannot scan safeentry	2
3302	I updated this app and then it instructed me to complete my profile but as I press next it wont go to the next page and I'm stuck on that same page. I already untilled and then reinstalled but the same thing happened	2

3309	Great app. Can't understand so much feedback about inability to switch the language.. But some stats about number of devices, located nearby within a period of time would be helpful to be sure, that app really works and is not blocked by OS settings some how (battery optimization settings, for example).	0
3310	Unfortunately this really uses up your battery........... I like to use my phone for many applications and I am not in a position where I can have my phone charging 2 or 3 times a day.	1

3314	Bad experience I have. Every 10 seconds it's showing a notification to enable and disable bluetooth in the display . Due to that am not able to use any other app. When my result is Covid 19 positive, it showing Negative. Also it drains battery.	1

3322	Great initiative	0
3323	The app is excellent in my opinion considering the purpose behind this app. It fulfills the goal and it is simple to use. I see comments about look and feel, and being user friendly. Come on guys, this app is to help contain a situation and beat a pandemic, not to a lifestyle thing. There are some security concerns that the ministry is working on to fix.	0

3329	Verry bad	1
3330	i am satisfied.	0
3331	Just found out this has a bug that is effecting my pull down notification screen that prevents displaying all the notifications text. Brand new motorola G8 plus with all updates. The lower part of notification text is cropped. Have to uninstall this and wait for update as too frustrating. Before this 5 stars for the app. Update: Can resolve the problem by turning off the Covid app notification permission or other option is go back to v1.0.28 APK but can do via the play store.	1
3332	Still learning stage.	2
3333	Was working ok and then bang all of a sudden my battery drained by 80 per cent in 2 hrs. Checked my battery tool and it said that this app had been running solid for over 2 hrs and had drained the majority of my battery. Also made my phone go really hot. Uninstalled.	1

3338	Information given conflicts with all other advertised COVID-19 information. But what do you expect from Scomo	2
3339	There should be means to select the locations similar to singpass as not all would be able to scan the QR code. Case in point, myself with a defective camera in an otherwise perfectly functioning phone.	2
3340	Easy to download and set up. Anyone with privacy issues is clearly listening to to much ABC, every day we share way more of our privacy than this App will share and it will speed up our country returning to some semblance of normality.	0
3341	Why not open thawakkanlna?	2
3342	Very good and always up to date	0
3343	To check if its working just check under your Google (covid-19 notifications) account either threw settings or accounts depending on your phone. The app checks this before saying if its activated that's there's a delay. Multiple devices working for me without problems. Simple app that uses Google api. Would have liked it joined app with covidcare, also swapping between Ireland and NI app, this is not needed as the keys will be shared with other countries as well and you will be notified.	0

3345	Easy to setup and if it keeps everyone safe all good with me	0

3354	No issues registering. Worth having if it means saving lives, Australia is able to regain some semblance of normality, and a restart to our economy.	0
3355	Why doesnt it notify me when it decides it wants to become inactive? I expect a massive popup with only when I click do not show again does it go away!	2

3362	Zero bluetooth exchanges ever since update! Stop asking users to write in to the email or try with family members! We have tried and found the problem to persists regardless what we do. Reinstallation means losing ALL records! Do not do so if you are at risk of exposure!	2
3363	After update, I'm trying to set up and key in my details as required many times but says "temporary not available".	2

3375	Very dissapointing that location has to be turned on. If it's using bluetooth it should ask for that only. Why it asks for location as well? Disaster from a broad adaptation point of view.	2
3376	Have Oukitel C8 with Android 7 cannot complete registration. Seems a non starter in this case.	1
3377	Just website links ar binded. Don't waste your valuable time by downloading this worst app.	1
3378	Worst app why would they make such app which only supports latest verison of ios or android what abt those who dont have . And they implement individual must posses this app . Person cant even download .worst app hope u dont arrest me for saying this. Just updated the app on my device and now it wont open . Thank you	1
3379	Battery use it still quite extensive. However on a side note, if mobile network signal is bad or down, the app might not be able to connect to read and register the qr code right? Will there be a TT qr code in the app similar to the token for the personnel at the venue to scan?	1
3380	Excellent	0
3381	I downloaded the app and when I entered the OTP, it says wrong! I uninstall and tried again and same thing happened. Finally got in then NRIC they is wrong! This app is really not up to scratch, disappointing.	2
3382	Still will not run on my phone for more 30mins. It's almost as useless as Dan Andrews. And his experts.	2
3383	Everytime i try and scan a QR reader at a place i visit with this app it comes back saying invalid QR.	1
3384	Nice app love u qatar	0
3385	It has never auto updated, have had to manually every time after checking if updates were required.	2

3387	Not able to access, tried many times, always same msg is popping "An error has occurred try again"	1
3388	Drains battery!!! This wasted away my battery and is asking for 24hour full privacy surveillance and location tracking. Uninstalled with passion.	1
3389	Not working in new huawei p40 pro mobiles need support	2
3390	Hmm messed up my Bluetooth.. makes my wireless headphones drop connection very frequently.. uninstalled temporary to test and confirm.. so far after few hours of testing.. it's seems to be the culprit unfortunately	2
3391	I have an iPhone 10\nI have tried many time to enable notifications and it will not. \nI have removed app multiple times to reload, updated iOS, restarted phone and it will not allow to enable notifications or do what it is supposed to.  My wife and kids have the app on the same phone , it works for them, the steps for enabling and function is obvious.\n\nWish I could get it to work!!	2

3401	It drains my phone batt like crazy. After installing the app i need to charge 3times in a day when my phone is just fine without having to charge the whole day after i uninstall. Pluss it keep messing up my bluetooth headphones. Its convenient in a way where it saves the qr code of freq places. The Cons weight out the pros. Until they fix this i womt be using it.	1
3402	Awesome	0
3403	Works great as far as I know. Downloaded and registered it with no probs. The whole thing only took a couple of mins. Doesn't seem to affect battery life much on my Android phone. Apart from the cute Aussie logo, I'd never know it was on the phone. I just leave it running.	1
3404	The app is very helpful nowadays during this global pandemic in monitoring and detecting positive cases. The app name itself reminds us to stay safe and once all of us used it, I'm sure we can stay safe.	0
3405	Use ful	0
3406	i get this was done in a hurry but SOME testing should have been done before release, asside from battery drain it goes into a Bluetooth pairing fit every few minutes (audio clicks & stutters, looses bluetooth pairing) makes phone too annoying to use (uninstalling fixed it ... i wont reinstall)	2
3407	Great app but could we also have a smartwatch version? Many smartwatches already have bluetooth enabled by default and it would be a waste to not make use of such technology for those who have smartwatches. Of course those who do not have smartwatches can use the phone version as well or the token.	2

3413	This app is redundant and it's only purpose is to help drain your battery faster, now electrical bills very expensive you know? So troublesome for what hastily release a flawed app and force everyone to install, don't even get me started on security risks. Might as well just give all of us a tracking device.. oh wait.	1

3429	So the app didn't allow me to book a test for 10 days after arrival.. went to exhibition centre and was advised to call 444.. called 444 and they said they cannot book the test either.. then a doctor calls me to confirm I do not have symptoms and says that I do not need to do a test.. so I ask for a refund and they say the 2nd test was free..?! So I had to pay for the test in advance but they cannot book an appointment so I paid for nothing? Don't travel to Bahrain unless u want to donate 30bd!!	1
3430	Update: 14 July App force closing after update. Tried deleting cache and reinstalling, but not working Simple, nice and informational app for masses. But I have an observation/suggestion: Why 12 pm - 12 pm (that is noon)? Why not reset daily counter at 12 am (midnight) as the date starts.	2
3431	Crash application	2
3432	As a user I would want to know if someone who tests positive has sneezed near me. This takes less than 10 seconds. Not sure why the digital handshake is set at 15 minutes. I would rather it be 2 minutes or less	2
3433	Don't know why this app is created	1
3434	FIN Verification failed on your app. While my FIN is verified by SGWORKPASS as valid. please check.	2
3435	Very basic	0
3436	App works well, except after last update its starting to have a lot of background battery usage, which is far from ideal on a tracking app, some optimization would be good to see regarding that. Update: google play services using 111% and covid tracker 40% battery, phone temp was super high, battery drainage was high, uninstalled and temp and battery drain are gone, please solve this issue fast so I can reinstall this app since it is a critical app nowadays.	1
3437	can't really tell if it works - should be a displayed count of people you've been in contact with to show it's working. Need an "i think i have it but haven't been tested" option - I'm sure many won't bother with a test. wasn't sure it had correct permissions - on android 10 there is option of permission only while app is open in foreground - which obvs is no good for this, and if i open the app it often says initially that it isn't active!	2
3438	Be better if more people used it. \n\nImprovement suggestion: Add ‘Details’ to scanned entries as well as the manual entries. So can record who with...	0
3439	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0

3442	No problems with the app at all here. It's just disappointing that the app hasn't been as useful as it promised to be.	2
3443	Very easy to download and set up. All the lower ratings seem to be people attempting to set it up before the official launch time.	0

3445	StaySafe PH is a great health app. It can tell you about your health. Absolutely awesome initiative. Really appreciate the developers effort.	0
3446	Hey, this is cool and all... but it needs an off button - I come home often, because I am self-isolating, but this is only useful when interacting with the community, so can you please give me a way of turning this off when I am home? At this point, I basically have to uninstall this every time I come home, just to shut up the notifications.	2
3447	I've turned this covid app off, have a new phone and still having problems with battery drainage when app is in use. Poor design get it sorted!	1
3448	Statee that my NRIC is wrong and couldn't log in at all, please assist..	2
3449	Great idea and service, execution not so good. My battery on a Samsung S10+ only lasts now to about 5pm (9 hrs) whereas it usually would last double that. I've installed the update today and will test again. /Update/ since updating to the newer release the battery is not badly affected. Increased to 4 stars.	0
3450	Drains the battery	1
3451	I'm not convinced it works. Everytime you open it, it come up tracing not active, even though bluetooth is on and it says you can close the app and it will keep working.	2

3453	Tried to lock in but encountered 2 issues 1.When I tried to enter the OTP, it said that I entered the wrong OTP.Entered and check again and again but to no avil 2.When I tried to enter my IC number,it said it was wrong.Entered and check again and again but to no avil	2
3454	Good day... Wanna ask questions regarding this application. My friend came april 5 here and then he was quarantine for 14 days. But the thing is he didnt Registration for this application because he doesnt have active number here in Bahrain. The airport allow him to leave the airport without doing the proper way on registration on airpot. Now he is already done on quarantine and he cannot be able to do appointment on the final check up . He tried to use different active number still not working	0
3455	Great innovation to contact tracing. However, from my few days experience, it may affect: 1) Wireless earpiece, connected via bluetooth, to your phone as it may disrupt your music from time to time with 1-2 seconds pause and resume. 2) Battery drainage, usually my phone would last from midnight till the next night but as this app runs in the background it uses up my phone battery and I have to charge it more frequent than I used to.	2

Would be nice if they were more transparent and open about this app and precisely what it does but other than that I don't think there's anything to panic about here.	2
3469	Something need to be done to improve this Apps as it goes to inactive by itself without warning and need my constant awareness to check whether it is still active with the green icon. It just defeats the purpose if it does not works as it required to.	2

3641	20/3 tip: the OTP always doesnt work on the first try. Hard close the app and try again and it will work. \n\nI think its a great idea but hopefully it will be able to work with the app in the background instead.\n\nTo all the negative nancys out there, yes there are bugs and yes the app is not perfect but its a start and a good idea in the very least. If you are socially responsible enough, you wouldnt mind keeping if in power save mode in the background. \n\nPersonally, I will listen to music during commute so I will play it in the background while keeping this app on in the foreground. I only use it when i’m in public spaces with crowds so its not a big deal if it has to be on in the foreground for a while to work. If u label this as a useless/lousy app just because you rather watch videos/ scroll through social media than keep this on in the foreground, maybe it just shows what you prioritise as a person.	2

3648	Good app to start with!\n\nHowever, suggest to use GPS from the service provider, instead of opening the app and running it in the background — May want to refer to Pokémon go (adventure tracing) where it can tracks location and distance whole the app is closed.\n\nWaste of battery and heats up the phone.\n\nThe application runs too slowly or crashes on older iPhone models.\n\nAnother suggestion is to only turn on the app when the user is in a crowded place, meeting, dining, where one lingers more than 30min.	0

3690	The user BD and IC date of issue input was buggy for phone set to RTL Layout for lefty like me. Please be considerate to lefties.	2
3691	Has potential to help future researchers in a small way. Probably won't keep YOU safe now. If you can followup the indicators or hints it gives that might be useful. About as useful as a bluetooth STI tracker for sex workers.	1
3692	Best app	0
3693	I am not able to check in as whenever i am clicking on the check in link it's disappearing automatically and there is no way or place in the app to report any technical issue. I am getting automated calls that i have not checking in but no one is picking the call even on 151 to resolve this issue. Sonu Mewada	2
3694	This app not working on my phone?? also CovidSafe app I can't even download it ??	2
3695	The idea is great, but still drains the battery even after reinstalling it after recent update.	1
3696	Still beta virsion...hope to have a good service from this apps.i installed already	0
3697	Good app, keeping me safe. I am happy so far.	0
3698	Such a pathetic app. By God's grace I'm so for n fine but this bloody app is showing moderate risk for past 8 days bcz of which i cant even go to work. This bloody thing had happened for the 4th time in last 2 months. God knows why such useless app is even necessary to be installed. Pathetic.	0
3699	Registration failed terus!! OTP delay, dari kemarin coba sampai hari ini masih belum bisa registrasi, tolong diperbaiki jangan mempersulit kami yg membutuhkan sebagai persyaratan berpergian! Terima kasih	2

3714	Great work Pakistan	0
3715	Don't exactly know if it works since I am not able to see my tracing data. Latest update gets too much personal data, why does this app need NRIC? Almost all apps have stored using nric. Also the recent update for safe entry needs more functionality to be fully effective, I am able to get my individual bar code to show a scanner at the mall, but am not able to qr scan for signs in parks, etc.	2
3716	Amazing app first review	0
3717	The app is affecting my bluetooth headset audio. Intermittent audio occurred and pausing the app bluetooth does not help. I need to uninstall the app in order to resolve the problem. Please resolve so that i can install again.	2
3718	The new version is much better. Currently it has barcode. It will be good to add QR scan here as some places like markets only have QR code	0
3719	Steels data	2
3720	The app interferes with the bluetooth connection of Samsung phones. After installing the app on my and my family members Samsung phones, it causes our bluetooth devices to drop the connection with the phones. Now we cannot connect with our devices. Please fix this. Thanks	2
3721	This app messes with my microsoft bluetooth mouse and keyboard, so I have to switch it off when charging my phone at home. I turn on bluetooth and run the app only when I go out from now on. Please fix this problem ASAP. Also Android keeps nagging about its power use.	1
3722	Good initiative to aid contact tracing. However, bluetooth audio is disrupted and music playback will be interrupted every 10-15 seconds which is irritating. This is especially relevant in an office setting where users will be on Bluetooth earphones and where tracing is important. Please look into the issue if its resolvable. Battery drain is manageable on a Samsung Note 8.	2
3723	Was alright until it started draining the battery. Have uninstalled until you fix this issue.	1

3731	Draining my battery power when is there going to be a fix	1
3732	Recent updates are draining the battery. It consumes more than YouTube every day, even watching a few videos. Fix it or people will end up uninstalling. And do we need to be 15mins with someone infected to get infected? Should be reduced to 3 or 5 mins. Otherwise useless.	1
3733	Nice aps	0
3734	I don't see why this is mandatory when it functions the same with scanning QR code manually outside malls. Pretty retarded. Unlike SingpassSG app where you could just Check-In to nearby places near your GPS location. Locals do s*ck at making apps and anything tech do they.. lol	1
3735	Do NOT download it behaves like VIRUS... It wants to use the Bluetooth and when I turn Bluetooth off my tablet (Xperia Z2) started to behave very strange. I couldn't use other apps or even couldn't listen music with Bluetooth off. After removing the program tablet gave errors and stopped working totally and unfortunately I have lost very much data because of this program.	1
3736	A few days ago, this app started draining my battery. I was out on the Bay when I noticed my phone shut down. Had I gotten into trouble out there, I would have been unable to call for assistance. I couldn't shut off the app so I had to uninstall it. Please let us know when this is fixed. I tried to write a second review but I can only edit my first one. I reinstalled the app after I learned that the problem was fixed. Except now I can't use the Covid check-in feature because I had to re-input my profile yet it won't let me confirm changes to my profile. The button just doesn't work. Aaaargh!	1
3737	as of now, this is a better version that the previous one but hope the links works better and more accurate, used the user ids instead the hastag numbers because... hirap kaya intindihin, and looking forward na even sa links indicated health stats. salamat and more power sa developer.	0
3738	Just tried to join this as was on the news but doesnt let you change country so wont accept my phone number...	2
3739	This app just doesn't seem to work in my class three people were infected by Corona and the whole class went on a quarantine but it did not give me any notification i don't have Corona but i think it's important that this app works quick and I'm not gonna have a app which is just useless and is driving my battery down cuz of Bluetooth .	2
3740	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0
3741	Asks for GPS location. I uninstalled this app because it kept asking me to enable Google location services, therefore accessing my GPS location. This is in stark contrast to what was claimed.	2
3742	Would be good that this app gives some kind of feedback to its user. It could record the number of Bluetooth it came in contact in 1 day and indicate to its user when the number of connections was too great a risky behaviour of social distancing	0
3743	I can't access my Report. Such bad Designed App. They Ask me Mobile No. Of ICA for Result and I don't know What No. Does my company have In ICA Useless	1
3744	Amazing Application for show destination	0
3745	I installed the app because I believe it will be useful in slowing down the spread of COVID 19. After a few days, I noticed that my phone was taking an unacceptably long time to load new email, search for products on Amazon or upload scores to the Golf Canada app. In fact, it was so slow that both the Amazon and Golf Canada apps stopped working. There were other operations that were affected by the slow down. I tried rebooting the phone several times, but there was no improvement. I finally deleted the app, rebooted the phone and now the performance is back to normal. My phone has 128GB of memory and I do not have very many apps installed, so it is not as though it is overloaded. I’m very disappointed!	1
3746	Bad. Just another app requiring us to give permissions that are not need in the name of security!	1
3747	I am so grateful to the developers of this app and to Health Canada for implementing it. \nOne suggestion would be that the app be compatible with the Apple Watch. \nAs a healthcare provider, I do not take my phone into the patient room. I realize that this decreases my chances of the app being accurate for my potential exposures. It would be great for providers to have their watch detecting exposure, since I expect that most, like me, do wear them in the room. \nThanks again for the innovative work!	0
3748	This app is not working as it should be too slow , showing wrong credentials everytime. Its worst experience ever I had with any such important app. Need to fix asap.	0
3749	I have an up-to-date iPhone 5S and I can’t download the app. It’s not a very good public safety tool if it can’t be used. I hope the developers make this app workable on more than just the newest phones.	1
3750	Yo why does the app require use of Bluetooth??? It interferes with the signal of my other Bluetooth devices and causes them to keep cutting out. Can't you guys like i dunno, make it more user friendly if the whole of SG needs to use this app?	2
3751	Keeps changing the bluetooth name of my Pixel 4a. So damn irritating!	1
3752	Bluetooth Range. Class 2 (the most common kind) operate up to 10m (33ft), and class 3 are the least powerful and don't go much beyond 1m (3.3ft). Why not use mobile data to monitor the entire city, country or world?	1

3762	Went to dinner with 3 friends last week. A couple of days later 3 persons recieved a push notification (possible contact to a positive person from that date & time). I did not recieve a notification, although i was sitting at the same table with the others. For me, it remains questionable how efficient this tracing method really is... :-/	2
3763	Indian government games with public	1
3764	Contact tracing cannot be enabled. You click "enable" and nothing happens. I tried a few times over the last month	1
3765	Since I installed the app I need to charge my battery already in the middle of the day (instead of just reaching bedtime).	1
3766	App is not opening on Samsung note 20 and it says tawakkalna keeps stopping. Its working on other android phones. Before it should open fine with no issues at all. Deleted and downloaded again but still not opening. Kindly assist in this matter	2
3767	Had this on my phone from day one but found in the last few weeks my battery had been draining very quickly. Discovered the app was using more than 50% of my battery each day, so had to get rid of it. Great idea, but terrible app.	2

3776	If its working its 5 stars. But it doesn't seem to keep the tracker on when I leave app. When I open the app I have to enable the tracker (it does auto enable when I open the app, but initially is disabled). I also checked the exposure checks in my settings and there doesn't seem to be as many checks as I expected.	0

3781	Soo how can visitors apply here they don't have Emirates Id??	2
3782	Gr8 idea! My 2 cents (each rated for 1 extra star) : 1. You really should add usage statistics like how many users (EXACTLY) have downloaded and of how many have activated the app (REALTIME) 2. How many users have reported ill - there is very little point for this app, if half of the downloaders don't activate it. And there is NO point, if only 10 individuals have reported ill, even if a million people installed. This simple info should be available for all activated users (MOTIVATIONAL!).	2

3805	Works well. It Sufficiently protects personal data and is stored on your own phone for 21 days. The permanent notification in the drawer is annoying. I guess they have to cater for all the old phones out there too. A setting to turn it off though would be great.	0
3806	Was a good app, but battery drain issue means I had to uninstall it. Please fix it so I can use this app again.	1

3854	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0

Untill this is fixed I will not be downloading it. And it's a shame because i liked the app. Please let every one know because im sure they'd like to keep themselves and their families safe	1
3861	Awesome app	0
3862	people who hate the government are saying this is a good idea, you have an independent code review who decompiled the app and said it is safe, and you have a chance to make your life, and those around you safer, you have to put aside your fears. If ur worried about data loss, do some research about what the app does. It captures contact with someone else's Bluetooth signal and logs it. Location perms only because in Android, access to Bluetooth is tied into the same permission as location req.	0
3863	Error connecting for first time registration! kindly help	2

3869	The app request to access calls and gallery, which is not accepted as no upload is featured in the app, and application is not working with it. The application should be the same as the iphone one, not requesting for the access to gallery. Waiting for the application to be fixed to load it, as the idea is great and i wish to support it.	1
3870	Good improvement with additional features. Thanks.	0
3871	Still terrible. Thought I'd give a chance for them to have another cycle of app updates but nothing improved. Bluetooth earpiece totally cuts off when this app is scanning. Definitely not earpiece issue as I have tested it on more than one device. Cant uninstall because I love sg (who's kidding? Its needed for my workplace else I'm not allowed in)	1

Really frustrating. I have asked about this problem twice but am redirected to the FAQ, which don't offer a solution to this issue.	1

3936	I had waited my OTP for so long. And yes, it will never arrived, bruh. Uninstalled this application for good. Good bye and have a nice #DiRumahAja day!	2
3937	I'm a supporter of the concept but have serious doubts about the utility of this implementation. I've not heard of any positive track and trace outcomes in months. At the same time the current version now drains my battery at about twice the rate of all my other apps combined. The government now has a short time to show cause why this app should be retained, otherwise I plan to uninstall.	2
3938	Question mark, press to verify not work	2
3939	This app has caused unusual behavior to my Oppo Reno 12. The Notification sound activated very frequently and the icons shown top of my phone blinks even after Bluetooth was turned off. After running scan via Phone Manager app, then only my phone back as normal. Please check the app compatibility.	2

3945	Yes, now a days in my mobile also showing question mark	2
3946	There should have explanation in the update of the following: The color of the logo has changed from blue to red. It requires more information such as NRIC. Name, etc. I am not comfortable to provide the additional info without clear reason, which was not required in the first version.	2
3947	Neat and clean app. Set and forget. Everyone should install this, there is no reason not to. Could do without the permanent notification that needs to remain active.	0
3948	This app is wrking perfectly 1)easy registration 2) simple to use 3)home screen is not stuffed with unnecessary info 4)keeps you updated on covid 19 cases 5)functionality of work permit is to be checked(did not obtain permission to move out during curfew while writing the review) 5/5	0

3950	No option to reset personal information when registering. Tried contacting the number provided but no answer.

4009	This app is so lousy. Cannot be installed on Huawei phones and androids of older OS. It also must be connected to wifi or mobile data. It also cannot use the QR scanner as an independent entity for SafeEntry, so without internet access this app is useless. Should have more languages too.	2
4010	9 days into quarantine and the app stopped working. The wheel counting down the days is frozen. I get messages telling me to check in but when I go to the app it says no check in is needed at this time. Absolute waste of time.	2

4022	I downloaded the app, but once i open the app for first time the app says it does not work on rooted phone. Bare in mind my phone is not rooted and i am using samsung galaxy note 10+	2
4023	My phone is in English and the app got installed in English nicely. Easy to activate or deactivate (if you don't like having your bluetooth on all the time). Nothing more is required.	2
4024	You receive a PIN text to you, and have to enter that as a verification. I entered it and it states \u201cnot valid\u201d contact health officer for another PIN. Couldn\u2019t find anywhere to contact for this, so not wasting time stuffing around with it.	2
4025	Everytime the application does a scan or update it disturbs the sound (music) being run by other applications. Seriously annoying.	1

4029	Took days before I actually got it downloaded, I don't know whether from high internet volume or multiple downloads happening causing slow traffic	1
4030	This is a great app and just what South Africa needs to avoid a second wave as restrictions lessen. However, the government now needs to promote the use of this app, explain how to set it up and make it clear that users’ privacy and anonymity is preserved. The app is only effective if a large portion of the population is using it, so it’s now time to raise awareness and educate the public.	0

4056	A few days ago, this app started draining my battery. I was out on the Bay when I noticed my phone shut down. Had I gotten into trouble out there, I would have been unable to call for assistance. I couldn't shut off the app so I had to uninstall it. Please let us know when this is fixed. I tried to write a second review but I can only edit my first one. I reinstalled the app after I learned that the problem was fixed. Except now I can't use the Covid check-in feature because I had to re-input my profile yet it won't let me confirm changes to my profile. The button just doesn't work. Aaaargh!	1

4098	Great initiative however we need make it mobile. Bluetooth consumes too much battery and thus after 3 or 4hrs it may fail as the phone runs out of power.	2
4099	Initial review with the first release was bad. However, after the ongoing updates most the issues where addressed and it is a perfect application for the current situation. Challenging though to convince people to install it since they're worried about privacy which should not be a big deal for the purpose this app delivers and how it could save you	1

4111	Good effort and nice job.	0
4112	Unfortunately, a lot of misunderstanding among people. It's a really simple app. All you need to do is download it and let it be. It will work behind the scenes and inform you if something happens going forward. It uses Bluetooth to communicate with other mobile phones. While at home you can turn off Bluetooth and turn it on when stepping outside. It will only be effective if many people download it. So please understand the purpose of the app before making any rash decisions. Take care!!	0

4181	As per title. It’s not a very smart decision to make to force us to turn on Bluetooth & leaving it on as it drains a lot of my battery especially if I have to leave the app running in the background. Even if we bring a power bank along with us, it will also get drained out. How many power banks do you expect us to bring along? 100?\n\nAs a developer, you can’t just think from your own point of view. You’ll also need to factor in things like user experience, usability, practicality & your app isn’t the only app we are using. I use my phone for work & I can’t afford for my phone to die on me just because your app drains my phone of battery. And these days, we’re trying to travel light, am I supposed to bring along 100 power banks along with me to ensure my phone battery doesn’t die on me when I’m outside? Please take into consideration that we may not be near a power source for us to plug in our phones 24/7 or be rich enough to buy 100 power banks or have enough space in our bags to carry all these power banks or even find it light enough to do so.\n\nLast but not least, if you guys want to force us into using something you guys created, at least please make it a pleasant experience & not make us hate or detest it even more. Wouldn’t it be better to make this app so fantastic & lovable that everyone WANTS to use it & not because we’re being forced to go through a torturous experience?\n\nThank you for reading through this valuable feedback & looking into the matter.	1

4187	Downloaded this app when it was available. I live in BC and so far there is no reporting in my area with no indication when I can expect it to be functional. BLUF this app is useless for people who live outside of Ontario and Quebec. The development of this app had the right idea and intent but the GoC failed to meet its objective to give all Canadians a tool to help combat COVID 19. I will continue to physical distance, frequent hand washing and kindness to everyone as they so far have proved the most effective methods to date. I have no confidence that this app will protect Canadians.\n\nThis is an app was released almost 2 months ago and still no reporting in my province (British Columbia). Still disappointed that we can’t utilize this GoC initiative in my home province. I understand the delay in getting all provinces on board but 2 months is ridiculous.	1
4188	Firstly, this app ABSOLUTELY interrupts wireless Bluetooth audio devices. Every earbud and speaker I've paired with will get distorted audio when it polls/triggers a search of the vicinity. It's so bad that here I am, leaving a 1-star review \u2014 you've got to try it to believe it.	2

4198	An epic battery killer. Constant technical popups not related to the purpose of the app. Tracking turns itself off despite Bluetooth, location and wifi being turned on. And again, uninstalled because it keeps draining my battery in hours.	1
4199	For the app to be effective are participants clear that they must sign in everyday.	0
4200	Fab app. Keeps you informed. It's our civic duty to all use it	0
4201	help me to get information around my house, but the app is not stable, I got it in error every day.	0
4202	Good	0
4203	The more people use it the better. PLEASE INSTALL THIS APP on your phone. It is privacy preserving. You may notice that It requires your phone having "location on" because it depends on some Google libraries that need it, but the app does NOT use those tracking features! As other computer scientists have mentioned, please trust us on this, this app is inoffensive. It can save lives, please install it.	0
4204	Great app, thanks for updating based on users reviews.	0
4205	Is very very os wanting to know what you think you should have been working	0
4206	The app is good last night i have recieved my COVID 19 test result by text message through hospital i login today registered successfully but app saying no test result found please assist on it many of my friends already getting results through this app	0

4209	Worst app ever created for a government agency. Drained my batt thanks to your app functioning in the background. Disrupt all my other BT connection from my fitbit to my jbl earpiece. Need to keep restarting my phone in order for my other BT devices to be able to be detected by the phone again. The app notification is really annoying. Everytime the notification pops up, my other BT devices got disconnected. Not everyone in SG owns a brand new phone. Be mindful when creating an app for the nation	1

4217	The app drains too much battery! Bluetooth uses the microwave frequency spectrum in the range of 2.4 GHz to 2.4835 GHz, the same as the microwave oven. Can you be sure it's safe for our health in prolonged usage? Telco do have location records which you can track as well. If this App is as good as you claimed, why do you think Safe Entry was created? To complement or compensate this App? Why do you think so little people installed, not to mention those who uninstall right after? Bad experience..	1

4227	Like all android users here I experienced battery drain over the weekend it was so bad that 4 cores were running at 100% with nothing running causing the phone to physically overheat. After 3hours dead battery Had to factory restore the phone as deleting and uninstalling the app had no effect. WILL I REINSTALL THIS APP ?, as one who installed this app within a few hours of it being released and was keen to do my part to help stop the spread of the virus hmm I won't be as quick this time!	1
4228	I was installing the app while shopping and have difficulty in login process.But when i got back home and download and install and very easily done .	2
4229	Good idea	0
4230	The developer email address doesn't work - just bounces emails back. I wanted to provide feedback on the installation question - "are you from NI?" Surely the question should be "do you live in NI?" I'm not from NI, but I live there. I can see it putting off plenty of "blow-ins".	1
4231	Affects my Bluetooth.... and it uses alot of battery power... I thought this was designed to make things easier not harder! Considered uninstalling it... alot of money has gone into this app...	1
4232	It's simple to use and it has excellent user privacy. Just keep your bluetooth on and it will do its magic.	0
4233	Good	0
4234	Hey guys, there must be something wrong with the app in the background, my phone keeps deactivating the app and I have a warning that it's not active, but when I go in the app it says everything is working fine. Then 5 mins later (more or less) it's goes offline again. Then the phone is happy. Then again later on it's all turned off. I got no idea what is going on here	1
4235	Good app	0

4237	Good	0
4238	Very easy and quick to install. For those having trouble with their phone number, you always need to drop the 0 before your mobile number when it follows the country code (+61 for Australia). So nothing wrong with the app!	0

4241	NICE EXPERIENCE....I LIKE THIS APP..	1
4242	Still not updating and continue Getting error "some things went wrong try again later" and unable to register using Iqama ID an Date of birth.	2
4243	Even when the phone is not being actively used. Please triage and fix asap since this may cause many people to remove it.	2
4244	I cant add my kids to the app using their Emirates ID	1
4245	Drain off battery fast for samsung note model	1

4248	Very informative. We are happy ?? to know health concerns in our place, in our country and the world. We are constantly reminded to be extra careful of ourselves, family members, our relatives, friends, neighbors and the community at large.	0
4249	Very bad	1

4251	Fake app	0
4252	Very happy to have this installed. For me the one drawback is the icon in the notification bar at the top of the screen, which is always there to indicate the app is running. It is a small green square. When I get a new WhatsApp message notification, it is also a small green square - and the same also for wechat messages. A different coloured icon would be good!	0

4254	This is another utter flop thing from the government it doesn't even warn us and i got free virus from thia app this app costed me 600 to get the virus out thats the only thing "Arogrya Setu" app gave me plz dont install this	1
4255	I cannot log nor I can put date of birth, its not working for me, not at all good app.	2
4256	After installing the TraceTogether app, other devices are pairing to my iPhone without asking for my permission. This is a major security issue.	1
4257	Great to find out this app is part of the Linux Foundation public health project, one of few that implement GAEN. Although it does not seem to be the best engineered and truly useful app for the purpose, the UI is good and provides useful stats. Lately, It started draining my phone (Samsung S7) battery at about 1% per min when Bluetooth was kept off at night (keeps polling for BT?) and hogs otherwise, though may not be the case on all phones. IMO use of GPS data along BT might have been useful, BT alone does not seem to be of much use, perhaps it is more of the available phone device platforms that restrict potential capabilities of this app otherwise I am sure the Developers would have done an even excellent job.	1
4258	You're all stupid! Anyone who downloads this app is a total idiot. May you all die of kung-flu.	2
4259	Absolutely hopeless. It tells me that my email address has an account but doesn’t let me open so when I reset my password it tells me that there is no account with my email. Therefore I cannot get into the app to use it.	1
4260	Nice aap	0

4293	Ever since I installed this app, I've been having many issues with my phone. The battery drains so quickly and the system lags all the time. I prefer using the SingPass app. Can't this app be removed altogether? It makes no sense to download another app when there is an existing app that works perfectly fine. Kindly look into this so that we can have less issues while dealing with this pandemic. Thanks.	1

This app has lots of potential to help "contact tracing" and therefore, limit the spread of COVID-19. But it needs stability	2

4334	Is it possible to remove the status card on the app? It's super annoying that I can't get rid of it. Still giving you 5 stars for creating an app for this purpose but the card is annoying. Also, why doesn't the app not track location? Bluetooth doesn't seem to be good enough.	1
4335	Same as everyone else. Killing my battery. Myself, my husband and our neighbours all have had to uninstall it. Shame as we did have it from day 1. Might re install if issue is fixed.	1

4349	Using this app prevents Google Play Store from downloading updates to all apps (there is bug in DownloadManager that causes app update downloads to hang at progress up to 100%). In addition, using this app stops push notifications of other apps such as WhatsApp, Gmail, MyEnv etc.... that are running in the background. I open WhatsApp to find dozens of new messages when I am running TraceTogether. This behaviour has been observed on both my husband's and my phones.	2

4363	It is not working	2
4364	App developer should overcome IOS constraints and not use this as an excuse for bad UX.  Should add QR code scanner within App and users just need to scan location QR code like what they do in China.  Buses, MRT, other public transport, supermarkets, and all shops can have individual location QR code to enhance tracing efforts.  Now every business have their own scanning and queuing system and it’s so inconvenient for users.  Why can’t SG Govt have a SG-wide integrated system ?	1

4392	For the last 2 months I am using this. But the tracer didn't find a single Corona Effect on his radar,!!. But I have moved from home to office every week!! Also no one will turn on his Bluetooth 24/7..!!	1
4393	When I load my mobile, it's says incorrect number.	2
4394	There's no real point in having this app. The alerts arrive way too late - one arrived with 4 days delay, another one with two days delay. There's also no timestamp, not even approximate one, on when you had this risky encounter. So you can't even reliably localize when you had this risky encounter and whether you should worry, or not.	1
4395	I think the purpose of this app is great & if a good percentage of the population use it that it would be very effective. Unfortunately it can only be useful if folks are participating. One down side that I have noticed is, as it runs constantly in the background it appears to be very hungry on the battery and therefore my battery life drains a lot faster than expected. At some point I'll have to determine the effectiveness of the app vs device battery life.	0
4396	Very very very Bad app because when update so working stop	2

4398	The app doesn't show the test results and ask me to login with a strange number.	0

4415	This latest version is definitely a much improved version. The downside is still the drain on the battery life. Also is there any plan to incorporate the scanning of QR code? It's nice to have the barcode for scanning but scanning of QR code can be much easier and faster instead.	2
4416	Nice app	0
4417	Although i really would like to keep this app for obvious reasons. Unfortunately it has caused my phone to lag and not preform as it had been prior to the installation of this app. If these issues are fixed? I would gladly download again.	1
4418	There is a common complaint that users with BT earphones are facing audio stutters with TT app. I faced such issues with my Samsung Note20 Ultra and earphones like Sony WF1000m3, Jabra 65t, and Jabra 75t. Pausing the TT app resolves the issue straight away. (Undeniable proof TT app is interfering with BT audio) I hope you can fixed this common problem. And please don't asked me for info like firmware, software versions etc or give template reply. Please work to resolve the common problem.	2
4419	Very good	0
4420	Same as below. Battery started draining this weekend. I uninstalled this app and problem solved. Developer needs to find a fix and publicise or the whole purpose of app will be defeated as more people uninstall.	1
4421	Nice	0
4422	Good initiative. However, despite the developer saying battery usage will be "marginally" higher, my personal experience says otherwise. I usually charge my phone first thing in the morning, about 7am. Previously, the battery level will drop to about 60% by 6pm. But with this app, the battery level is at 60% by noon!	1
4423	Can't add phone number - this app is useless	2
4424	Very easy to install. Only bug I faced was - getting an Invalid Phone No. msg many many times, was starting to get frustrated. However, reading through the reviews, found one that said you have to deactivate WiFi so that you get direct access to Mobile data, then it worked in a flash. Happy to do my bit in these inordinate times	0

App shows the message "Temporary unavailable We're really sorry. please try again later" I tried so many times during a few weeks. And even many times I did uninstall and install & try registration. But cannot finish the registration. Is this app no more valid? Is there any tip to solve this issue? --------------- After email conversation, issue was solved. Thanks	2

4430	It is not possible to record a video to confirm my identity because when you tap the Open Cam Recorder button it takes you to the file explorer and not the camera. It is also not possible to record the video saying the numbers and using that because as soon as you exit the app you have to start the whole process again and a different 4 digit number is shown. Extremely frustrating as I cannot complete registration now	2
4431	Awsome	0
4432	Maybe I just don't understand properly, but you have to manually input you have Covid, so why on earth would you be out in public, using an app that alerts people of it. Isn't this app kind of pointless as noones going to be aware they are Covid positive and mingling in public. IMO	2

4443	Senseless. "Turn on your satellite positioning system in order to use Bluetooth". This is after months of promising that the satellite positioning system would not be a prerequisite to use the app. A good cause and effort deeply stained by lies.	2

4480	Doesnt work properly with my phone. It doesnt keep running in background (Notification that its on doesnt stay). It closes itself (maybe when i use other bluetooth stuff like earphones). It doesnt start up with the phone. I need to re-start it everytime i go anywhere. Its a pain to keep using and i will be suprised if they get any useful data from it. Its a rush job and it shows and im giving up on it for now. Maybe some updates in the future will fix it for more devices.	1

4553	Very much effective	0
4554	Good to have, but FAR too late. And why is it limited to covid 19? Are there no other infectious diseases?! ;/ Very unclear whether this app works if you come in contact with soneone from outside NI who is running their own local app :( Also, it's just ridiculous that, in this global day and age, each area needs its own app. How much money did developing so many separate apps cost? Let alone for tiny places like NI. Someone should have balked at that, and said, "NO. Let's cooperate."	0

4561	It’s simple and easy to use. There’s no bug and I like how fast this was created for the benefit of our safety. However it would be great if it could work on the background. I constantly forgot to switch the app on when I’m out with others or to work. And when travelling it can be boring for me as I took 1.5 hour to travel to work. But other then that, I try my best to switch it on when I’m out.	0

4590	Very innovative and smart to use Bluetooth. I can't believe people would just give it a 1 star when the app is working fine. This app is for tracking purposes only. If so sian that the app make your phone lag then just off the Bluetooth if you're at home or close the app. When outside then open the app again la.	0
4591	Still doesn't work on Huawei P40 after so many months. Contacting support doesn't solve the issue. Shame on GovTech	2
4592	The idea behind the app js awesome, but the implementation is awful, currently its the only app that drains 25% of my battery, while I need to use my phone for work, I cannot leave such app tp run, so I had to enable battery optimization back, and disable the Bluetooth tracking. If this issue is fixed in the future might consider in enabling it again. Or might remove the app due to irrelevance, had a contact with a COVID carrier, app didn't notify... Discovered by other means...	1
4593	Worst app. No update or notification for recent contacts. It just show high risk of infection all the time when u feed some symptoms nothing else. I don't understand why the hell government developed it.. when it was of no use for public. It just shows stats of covid.. which anyone can check on google or websites.	1

4596	App works great ! How about allowing the user to record temperature within the app and allowing express entry without temperature checks if it has already been recorded. This will encourage more people to check their own temperatures and also allow quicker entry into places where there’s usually a queue to check temperature e.g at mall entrances. Thanks !!	0
4597	good app	0
4598	Deceased and recovered graphs are not visible due to use of incorrect colour combination. I mentioned coughing and it is showing me at high risk. I could be having common cold or dust alergy, corresponding options are not there. If I have already got tested, There should be a way to update test ID or SRF no and app should pull results from there. People will lie on test if incomplete options provided. Incomplete app, not reliable. it's been developed so quickly, but not improved for accuracy.	1
4599	Useful and simple app, everything is displayed clearly and all the needed information can be easily found on the application. I have my phone in English but the app is still displayed in Finnish, this is not a problem for me since I know both languages, but I would imagine that a language selection would be a good addition as one of the steps for setting up the application.	0

4607	The current version offers useful statistical information on the pandemics, but the app requires specific codes to declare ourselves previously or currently contaminated, codes which do not exist for those of us who got tested abroad or even contact cases.	1

4609	Seems consuming batt more than usual after this apps installed in my device...	1
4610	I need to uninstall and reinstall the app every time I activate it to make it work. This is rather frustrating and time-consuming, and defeats the purpose of being able to open the app and have it running at a moment's notice when you're near other people.	1

4632	Its annoying You can't close the app easily, and it requires Bluetooth After closing it starts nagging you and you can't close the notification And I dont understand why the GPS is always refreshing and wasting my battery, where there shall be an algorithm to optimization where the refresh rate is lower than an hour because further accuracy is not required at all	1

In addition, with TraceTogether running, my phone is unable to download or update any apps from playstore. The download/update will be stucked at 100% without installing them. Only way to make it work again is to force stop TraceTogether, restart phone then updates other apps.	2

4643	The app is grand does what it says to a point. Doesn't need location permissions or contact permissions and uses Bluetooth instead but not sure how effective this could be. It is completely idiotic that people think they can base their rating on how easy the app is to find in the play store. It has nothing to do with the app itself!

4675	Randomly got a warning saying “you may have been exposed in the last 14 days” while I was at home... that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever given how the app was described to work since no one around us has tested positive or reported it in the app.\n\nThis app also needs some serious UI considerations. The language of the exposure warning is vague and not helpful. If I was “exposed” in the last 14 days, does that mean that the exposure happened on the same day and time that the notification came up? Health Canada agents didn’t know when I asked! If it’s waiting multiple days from the actual exposure incident to give you a warning then that’s outright useless because in that window of time you could have been out there already unknowingly exposing others or getting yourself exposed! That kind of defeats the purpose of this tracing app entirely!	1

4741	User-friendly and no battery drain. I didn't have to use the QR code function yet. So much better than the french one lol.	0
4742	We need this app to be available to HUAWEI phone. Pls upload this app to Huawei App Gallary, so that HUAWEI users can also install this app.	2

4744	Great app until a couple of days ago. It's burning out the batteries all of a sudden. Where is the update to fix this bug? I heard on the news it was sorted but I don't see any update available. Please hurry	1
4745	Where do the county figures come from? The total of county figures seems never to agree with the NPHET daily total. Also, why are the county figures 2 days behind? Actually, this evening they appear to be one day behind. Or is the date (27th) wrong? Earlier this evening it was showing a May date!	2
4746	This app causes major battery drain Google Pixel 2. New mobile coming, will try again. Was the last app installed. Possible mobile too old.	1
4747	This app causes constant interference with connected Bluetooth devices.	1
4748	In reply to the developers, I hope this helps. My mobile is Samsung Note 20 and using sony wf-1000xm3 for my Bluetooth earpiece. I am beginning to feel that other brands might also be facing the same thing. This means Trace together is lagging or cutting off the sound. If you don't do something, these major brands might start questioning if their customers have to choose between the earpiece or trace together. Hope you can do something. I had shared what....	2

4757	Very funny.. i type my ic number till can't work..	2
4758	Dare to make it compulsory by year end when it still has issues! Used the latest update and it still has issues with my note10+. Please go and get your own note10+ to test. Calendar events & reminder notifications are delayed! And it can't even detect the tracetogether token. What's the point then?	2
4759	After new update, appear popup "the app keep stopping" if we try to get in. Solved! You must give full permission for your bluetooth, not only when we use the app	2
4760	Doesn't restart automatically after switching the phone to airplane mode, you have to manually switch it back on again each time....	1
4761	Great apps?	0
4762	Bad. Spotify becomes intermittent immediately when I download this app. The music keeps on skipping and pausing. I had this issue when you first launch this app. But I uninstalled it bcos if this issue. Apparently nothing has been done months after I uninstall. This is a big hassle for me. Pls do something. Phone: Note 8 Firmware: Up to date android.	2

4781	I take the face pic but it seems it can't be sent becuase, after taking the picture the MOI demands from me to send the pic though I sent, so I call on the sent number of MOH but it does not response me.

4792	I'm in France so installed: I thought it was active, but wasn't.  To run in  background go to 'Settings' gear symbol then: Apps & notifications > Advanced > Special App access > Battery optimization. This critical or it's not running. Annoying is the msg to say it's running and inability to clear it's messages. So long as I see flash to say it's running in background I don't care to have irrelevant msgs always present. 4 stars because to stop covid19 is important	1

4809	Works fine in the background, doesn't eat my battery and easy UI.	0
4810	The App is great for tracking, however it would be good to be able to breakdown into the figures a bit more. On cases, deaths etc, it would be good to see where hotshots and outbreaks are. Currently in Kildare the % of cases is 6 % of total. But where in kildare? We should be able to click into kildare and then go into the towns within kildare and see how many deaths, cases have occurred. In this way it will remind us to be extra vigilant if there are rising cases in our town or area.	0
4811	i'm not a resident and i'm staying in Riyadh using a visit visa, how can i register to the app?	2
4812	I can't able to open the app	2
4813	Date of issue of IC is irrelevant for contact tracing. MOH has no authority to collect such data over and above the necessary info.	2
4814	A great initiative from the government to keep us safe and hopefully see us out of lockdown sooner rather than later.	0
4815	Everyone scan d QR code it need to download n start all over again like 1st time use.	2
4816	One star due to lack of transparency. Will you be providing the companion software/app to the LGUs to scan the QRs of users from this app? 'Cause, in order to receive goods or financial aids from the Govt., the citizen will be required of their true identity (Full Name, Birthdate, Address) which is necessary for liquidation. This is opposite to what you are telling the public. That you are not collecting real data. This is MISLEADING.	1

4824	Please remove the scrolling text in your covid people radius section. its an irritative feature of slow scrolling. Instead of Unnecessary news and large size labels, highlight "how many people near you are covid positive" in big sized text. You highlighted unnecessary things in big text size and necessary things in small text size with unneeded scrolling.	2
4825	Good initiative for stop spreading COVID-19. Now every human should play their role.	0
4826	Had problem singing up but that was fixed in later updates. Although the app is good i dont see any info related to tracking. Atleast show users travel history map. I know its being recorded than why not show as well. In addition the app should be able to automatically turn on bluetooth/wifi once permissions are given. Not sure why you keep asking the user every single time	2

4830	This app was working normally till 28th of June but now it didn't. the code of health status appears in big questions mar(?), does any one have the same problem? I do update and uninstall and reinstall and nothing happen!	2
4831	I personally thing the app is useless and it's stupid.... it crushes buttons not working ... I was hoping it has more information like health care information, health center locations, general health tips and consoling centers contact etc.... no use spending so much in a app which is not even working right	2
4832	It keeps interfering my other connected bluetooth devices e.g. earbuds, soundbar... by cutting off music, sudden increase/decrease volume and dropping the audio quality significantly. Also, idk if its due to this app, but after installed it some of other apps in my phone keep crashing and not working properly. Everything back to normal after uninstall this...	2
4833	Battery getting drained very quickly for app installation. Check In and Check Out features okay.	1
4834	Most feedbacks in this app is either bad or diabolical. Like really??? This is app is use for "CONTACT TRACING" not gps or any kind of app that hits your fancy.?? Here's my cent's, the app is not that bad, it has some minor UI problem but it can still work, LIKE HOW THE APP IS DESIGN FOR. Download it and use it, if you want to help just little then do it by using this app.??	1
4835	It keeps saying "temporarily unavailable" for the past month when i want to complete my profile. I tried uninstalling it but it is still the same.	2
4836	No OTP comes. Very hard. Very worst app. I am trying one hour to install this. Tried to call 109, getting reply from all costumer care executives are busy. I want to go out. I was just trying to re install the app to show my name and dates on ehteraz	2

4838	I have an iPhone 6, it's battery lasts longer to serve the purpose of this app, but this App requires iOS 13.1 and above which looses out to some iPhone users having 6s or previous generation phones. Can this be made compatible for older generation iPhones please?	1

4841	Unable to input the IC. Unable to activate app	2
4842	Good idea but somehow it will not work if other people doesnt have phone/internet who cant install the app still we could not detect others if they're probable or positive ones.we are not even sure if people using this app is stating their real health condition and the app itself will just rely on people's health update, coz even positive individuals are asymptomatic.notifs cant be removed and its also draining the battery.	0
4843	Stopped detecting other phones with the app installed. But the SafeEntry function works well.	2

4916	Ok, I only downloaded this app last night & although the reviews seem ok. This was the 1st & main app for COVID-19 tracking. Yes I realise Gibraltar is it's main domain, I get it. But seeing as this was my only option really, Am I just meant to look at the compass tracker, watching random green dots faintly appearing, with the blue screen just saying "Active"/click if i tested positive? How do i know? I don't! We can't just ask 4 test. Bluetooth is always on. So do i just wait 4 an alert? ?????	2
4917	3 days now I have question mark in my app. Cannot go to groceries even Woqod. Hotline is not useful at all. I tried everything including what they reply here for the other comments like reinstalling and clearing cache. Nothing is working. Please fix your app.	1

4927	Needs to be fixed ASAP. The app always says my credentials are wrong and tells me I have to log out and register with a number that ends with 788 which is not my phone number!! Also why is Bluetooth mandatory to use this app? This just drains battery for no reason	1
4928	Had to delete the App because my phone was discharging very fast & the screen was so hot afew times that I thought the phone was going to explode !!!	1

4945	The app is good,but i think you can make it more realistic and accurate by adding photo of the person.Because by name the police or any other authority won't be able to identify where the name and the person holding the app is the same. I have one doubt , whether this app can be opened in more than one phone with same QID.?	0
4946	a nice appa	0
4947	This software disturbs the mobile	1
4948	In the latest update, after we update key personal data such as NRIC number and NRIC expiry date etc, our data will be saved. These data can be obtained simply by opening the app. No login is required. Even the Singpass app which is also able to produce our NRIC barcode requires an authentication login to access the data. Please rectify this immediately. I can't even "log out" delete the personal data.	2

4956	Do not like the fact that it has access to every aspect of my phone. This is completely unnecessary with regards to reducing the spread of Covid-19. I appreciate the need to know my location at all times, as well as my contacts; other than this there is no feasible explanation for this app needing access to my emails, watsap, phone calls etc etc etc. It is a violation if my privacy.	1

5002	Battery lasts half a day. Haven't touched my phone all day. I took my phone off charge at 9am, now it's 1pm and I'm down to 50% battery. The only thing different was downloading this last night. Will have to uninstall.	1
5003	Ok	0
5004	My zain sim is provisioned...how can I get activation code...It take time to re activate my sim.But within 8 hrs we should register( for re entry peoples).Better to use mail id rather than mobile number	2
5005	I did test for Corona two days back and in the app it shows 'Not tested'. And when in the app the status is still not tested I received my test result by SMS. So I think it doesn't do what it should be doing.	1
5006	Version 2.0, safe, just Bluetooth, no location services needed anymore, no battery drain.	0
5007	It is practical but 80% people lie true status.	0
5008	Downloaded but doesnt work. Cannot go pass the filling personal info stage. Clicking the next button does not do anything. Already email tech support but still unresolved.pls help	2
5009	Drains my battery.	1
5010	Great idea, but it is completely draining my battery. Hardly managed to get past lunchtime when I have to charge phone up again, and this might not always be possible. Not much use if I my phone is dead and I come into contact with someone that may have covid19 ?? Unfortunately I had to uninstall the app ??	1
5011	Battery draining	1
5012	Good	0
5013	Really nice app.	0
5014	I've had no major problems. However the constant icon that appears with the install is annoying, I have a new Android so I was able to turn-off the foreground service notification for covidsafe in my app settings to get rid of it. I was unable to install the app to my elderly step dad's Samsung because despite only being a couple of years old it was incompatible. He reports that as a common issue amongst his peers. So I think there is room for improvement but no reason not to install it	1
5015	Very helpfull and acxurate detection	0
5016	Installation is an easy and a smooth experience. There will be a notification staying there for now to remind user it is running. Will be better to have a Chinese version available as I noticed done of my friends (they are seniors) doesn't know how to install it before they cannot understand English!	0
5017	Terrible Bluetooth consumes lots of battery power. Permission to run the app at background makes the battery consumption even worse.	2

5034	Good	0
5035	Very good performance	0
5036	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0
5037	Its really good app.	0
5038	After signing-in it does not open. I keep getting a message saying it keeps stopping and asking for app info and sending feedback.	2
5039	Very fast update but drain battery faster.	0
5040	I cannot add details of my family, it says 'invalid id'. Can someone please help	1
5041	I was advised to upgrade the app. I did so. However, the problem still persists. I have sent a few emails already. The scanner would not allow me to scan any Safe Entry at shops or malls. I had to return to using good old Singpass to get Safe Entry...otherwise I wouldn't get in.	2
5042	Unable to download this app. My phone is Samsung J7 pro. Tks.	2
5043	No option to turn off app when not in use. Huge battery drain. Who would have bluetooth enabled always? Regardless of your internal testing and statistics, basing your data on the consumption % displayed on a Samsung phone is not the correct way. It is a known fact that the battery consumption is not accurate and you did not consider the consumption by bluetooth radio in your faq.	1
5044	Can the developers come up with a solution to prevent the app from distrupting bluetooth devices connected to the phone?	2
5045	Sucked the life out of my battery	1
5046	Worst app i ever installed, didnt notify me when my brothers and my family who were xery near to me were affected and positive and neither it told me when they were negative again.	2

5050	Good to know that TraceTogether can now work in the background for iPhones too. Good job!!!	0
5051	Phone roasting and battery draining suoer quick... where is the fix for this. Installed the app the day it was released. Saturday 8th August received a message to say that an app was draining my battery... did I wish to put to sleep. It was the Covid tracker app. I selected yes. I have since deleted the app and attempted to clear the cache (of which there seems to be a lot?) Phone still very hot and eating the battery.	1

5060	The latest version is definitely improved and more intuitive to use, but I feel there's something wrong with Android version installed in Huawei (Nova3i) Mobile. I see very less count of interactions or sometimes even 0 whereas it shows a drastic difference with my spouse's Mobile which is Samsung S10. Kindly verify this case with your testing devices. Thanks.	2

5076	My number seems not registered. Showing different number and i can't move on.	1
5077	Worst app	1
5078	Whoever made this app has no common sense whatsoever. Firstly, as a national serviceman I do not have my NRIC and thus no way to see what my NRIC date of issue is. I had to go beg an incompetent S1 branch for it. Secondly, it takes such a long time to open the app. Huge inconvenience to users. Thirdly, the above mentioned points only apply if one is even able to set up the app(watching grass grow is faster and frankly less infuriating). Thanks for nothing.	2
5079	Good	0
5080	This app is better to detect and protect, but the application always forced close.. please fix it..	0
5081	Great app and will hopefully make a difference. However, only 4 stars because the app was very hard to find in the Play Store. I had to go to the existing HSE NI Covid info app, click on the app developer name at the top and see this as the only other app created by the HSE NI. If you just search for 'stopcovid NI' the app does not appear in the search results at all. I am not sure if this is something within the developers control but the more people who can easily find and download the better.	0

5100	After last update the app is constantly asking if I turned off my Bluetooth!! I never do! Also, because I have Apple Watch and I need Bluetooth always on... please fix!	1
5101	Hey I liked the app but I think 15 minutes of exposure is too long! As infected person could be coughing/sneezing next to you and then walk away and they won’t be detected as exposure. It only takes less than 1 minute to infect someone!	1
5102	Love the app! Can you not integrate it with restaurants so that we don't have to write our info at each place if we have the app?	0
5103	QR scan for safeentry is less stable than Singpass. It Keeps loading after scan the QR code . Please fix it!	2

5106	Terrible app. Had to delete it when it nearly roasted my phone. Battery was going from 100% to 30% in about 2 hours.	1
5107	It just says invalid phone number I have tried multiple times including uninstalling and reinstalling. Waste of time!	2
5108	Dont think this works to well	2
5109	The app is showing my test date as result and not result date...so now i cannot travel to Abu Dhabi on the planned date because it will be outside the 48 hrs....also they said result will take 2 fo 3 days now i got the result in less than 24 hrs....?  I  cannot plan my trip and cannot do covid test every day at 370 aed. Please fix your app....do the result date is shown and not test date.....1 to 3 days difference will affect people who must travel to Abu Dhabi emirate..	1

5114	After update it can't run at my Huawei mate 30 pro. Had try to uninstall & reinstall, it still can't work. Does it mean Huawei w/o Google are not welcome to use. (stuck at OTP). Everything is fine till OTP.	2
5115	Unable to update secondary student particulars. The options are only for NRIC, FIN or visiting Singapore.	2
5116	The worst app ever. Just stalking from third parties and sending your private data.	0
5117	The most unstable app ever made, it fails constantly and without warning. It's only a week since I installed it and yet I have removed and reinstalled it at least twice, just because I know its importance if we have to win against Covid-19. The worse part is, it fails during critical times and apparently there is no fix to this bug. I do not understand how it manages to collect data that way. Once it fails to load the only remedy is to remove and install it again. So much effort ????.	1

5149	It's not focused on privacy	2
5150	Note, there are times I want to check out, but the app keeps getting hanged. Kindly resolve. Also your scanning in and out of MRT is a sad joke. We scanned in, when we arrived at our destination, we are checking out from the station we check in. Surely, for MRT station, you should have a QR code for checking out. Especially, if we are transferring from one line to another line. The link is lost, and we end up losing track of whether we checked out. Most ppl ignore the QR code check in/out.	2

5191	Simple to use, however when one clear or kill apps, this app is killed too as it is not a locked app (can manual set). Also, this app is also not a auto start app on reboot, again one can manually set it. Concerns, can this App allow communication between iPhone and Andriod Bluetooth? In the older iPhone it can't, now not sure didn't try. If can't comm between the 2 platforms then it is a big gap for this App. Also can iPhone ver of this App run in background, if not, it's another gap	0

5214	Update: 1) Under Favourites, list should appear based on your location. Already the app takes note of user's location, so why can't Favourites list be included. 2) There should be a notification to remind users to check out after, for example, every 6 hours or so.	2

5222	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0
5223	Very informatif, but not stable	0
5224	This app has started devouring my battery in the last 48 hours. Tracking isn't much use if my phone is dead.	1

5226	It was ok at first, but i noticed lots of connectivity issues and CovidSafe was the last app installed, after uninstalling the app, connection issues appear to be resolved.	0
5227	Love the concept and fully support the need, however the app drained my phone from 100% to 6% in six hours. I need my phone unfortunately for my family contact. So have uninstalled until they fix this. If you don't fix this no-one will use it.	0

5243	useless apps... no results showing... it's two days past but still no results.	2
5244	Battery Killer. It's overusing the Google Play Services framework and it consumes a crazy amount of battery, almost 32% of battery usage was from it. I appreciate the commitment to trace and protect us against COVID exposure, but it's of no use if it just drains the battery and you can't even use it.	1
5245	Why on the earth does the app need access to my personal storage and data? I wish somebody could explain me the correlation between accessing our private stuff and stopping the spread of Covid 19.	1
5246	We need this app to be available to HUAWEI phone. Pls upload this app to Huawei App Gallary, so that HUAWEI users can also install this app.	2

5271	Can not get my PIN as it is saying my phone number is invalid. Dropping the "0" from the phone number is not helping. Still saying my number is invalid	2
5272	Unbelievable. Not only does the app not register but you cannot contact the developer or anyone to report the error. This cannot be required by law when if does not work for such a large number of people.	1
5273	It keeps crashing. Then I must uninstall and reinstall.	2
5274	Why stop	1
5275	Would be great if daily figures were more up to date. Just now checked on breakdown per county and it is showing figures for 31st July.	2

5297	I like this app coz is useful	0
5298	Can't register because it won't open the camera and won't accept a video. All permissions are granted, still won't work. Someone told me to activate Bluetooth for it to work (pretty random), so I activated BT, Wifi, data, NFC, hotspot, GPS, granted every possible authorisation, still won't open the camera.	2
5299	Note:Bluetooth tends to drain phone battery if used for long periods on top other apps Areas of improvement: perhaps the check in and check out function for safe entry can be incorporated so we can see existing check in locations and allow us to via app scan to check in. N remotely check out without needing to rescan	2

5353	Thumbs up for the idea! Hope it works just as well. Update: I wish it were possible to change a Google account to have location history of the phone to sync with the app. It only asked me once and there is no setting to change...	0
5354	Need to update, I test last 10th June, when I try to use this app not working it's showing different contact number, I received OTP and enter it but no log in.	2
5355	helps to keep us safe	0
5356	This app caused problems with Bluetooth devices on my phone not allowing them to connect or dropping out. I have a heart problem and use a bluetooth watch to monitor it keeping a log which I show my doctor. I have been force to remove this app as it interferes with this. I would have thought that after spending 1.5 million on development the government could come up something that works.	1
5357	This is app is a great help for giving updates about COVID-19 cases. The real time scanner is also an advantage for everyone that is going outside their home to detect possible cases near them. This app is also easy to use.	0
5358	Amazing idea but it won't let me sign up! Keeps saying my phone number is invalid so it won't text me the pin, even though I know my phone number is valid because I've been receiving calls on it. Any ideas?	0

5361	Cant even update from Huawei Apps Gallery nor Play Store...	2
5362	Has absolutely destroyed the battery life on my phone even after deleting it. Afraid it's malware or something.	1
5363	You NEED to use the Apple/google contact tracing API. I DON\u2019t think many people realise for this to work you need to keep the app open in perpetuity. That\u2019s unrealistic. Fix this waste of taxpayer money	1

5377	So far so good.......however would agree with other commentators that: a/ Needs a push notification reminder to 'Check in' b/ The percentages needed to be finer and tracked so we can see any changes. Whole figures doesn't show this c/ Maybe a Map facility to show ' Hot spots'	0
5378	Wow this app rocks! Construction industry ask us to all download this app and Covid-19 wuhan almost entered my mouth but this app flew open to block it! This is even better than "only wear mask when unwell" policy! Kudos to the scholar that invented this incredible app. Bluetooth is a new technology that is adopted! Beyond any overseas scholar's thinking, no wonder they are highly paid. Way to go!	0

5387	Mabilis maubos battery. Madaling uminit ang cellphone kahit d ginagamit simula nang mag download ng apps. Pag nalowbat galing sa trabaho, paano na makakapasok sa accomodation. At ang apps na eto ay tungkol sa covid 19, eh bakit kailangan pa na access nila ang mga privacy sa phone. Pls. Fix it. Baka madaling masira ang phone wala pambili ng bago.	1
5388	Latest: Uninstall app> Use Wifi> Install it> Register details again> Wait for next update to fail> Repeat. Previously: Got to update again. Failed to update... really? Let's see... install over any network set, autoupdate over any network set, reset phone yes, remove app done, reinstall why not...BS. Previous review: Provide FAQ to solve simply problem, like suggesting to restart phone is bluetooth causes app not to complete installation.	2

5397	Having the same problem described below. I own an OPPO phone and constantly get messages about disabling battery optimisation. I do so and within a few hours get another message. I'm sick of maintaining it. Fix it or I'll remove it and take my chances. I haven't yet seen any stats as to the success of the app in doing the job it's designed for. Unlikely if others are having the same issues.	2

5418	A useful app that causes slightly more battery usage but anything that helps to contact trace people potentially affected by the Chinese Communist Party Virus (CCP Virus), is worth having as an additional tool to help fight this Chinese biological weapon. If any good that came from this CCP Virus is that it revealed China's true colours & is helping the rest of the world in unititing in worldwide retribution against the CCP. Hopefully this brings a demise to this brutal and authoritarian regime.	2
5419	Good apps	0
5420	Can't load it as OTP not sent, the application drains the battery life and crashes Samsung S9+ . No battery no tracking so it's a fundamental flaw. Requesting access to media and other personal information is just wrong. Other than the fact the app is unusable I like the concept	2

5426	Complete useless	1
5427	App drains power, any fixes to the app for next release Why bluetooth need to be always on? Can't it only be manually switch on by user when using the App? Why App must always run at the background?	2
5428	The app does not warn Huawei device owners of EMUI's aggressive app killing behaviour that needs to be disabled in the phone's settings. It only warns of the Android-wide "battery optimization" setting.	2
5429	Seamless function. Great app. Let's kick the nasty bug in the nuts!	0
5430	Apart from occasional bugs (cannot check out) I hope they will improve on the followings from user experience:\n\n1) the home screen takes up half of the screen space and won’t scroll away. It also doesn’t offer any useful info apart from showing an image of three persons with active mobile phones. \n\n2) home screen should display a list of all checked-in places, instead of showing just the latest one. This allows users to see at once where have they not checked out yet instead of having to check out one by one.  We really have no time for this especially when our hands are occupied with heavy groceries.	2
5431	Not Working, some error .saying something went wrong. Please fix ASAP	1
5432	Great interface and good info. The thing everybody must understand when using this app is that its based on the trust that people wont lie.	0
5433	Latest update needs location services on. Why is that? It did not before. Gov web site says it does not record my location. Location services should not be needed. (Edit) It seems it needs access to location service, but location service can be turned off. Also app help says this is an Android limitation, location is not actually used.	2
5434	Great idea and initiative! Maybe can make it generic or put the code on public repo so other countries can adapt and implement for their own?	0

5440	Attempted to register and mobile number listing as invalid?? This is the same mobile number I have registered throughout varied state and fed government services (myGov etc). When I wasn't sure about signing up in first place, such a frustrating start doesn't encourage me to bother with this app. Sorry ScoMo I gave it a chance	2
5441	Why do you need to know date of birth and date of issue of NRIC in order to use this app, if it's purpose is solely for tracing covid-19 contacts? Reply to app developer: Are you saying that the safe entry we have been using all these months are not effective, since it does not require the input of our date of birth?	2

5453	Doesnt support basic functionality of SingPass Track and Trace app such as favourite locations nearby. Bluetooth consumption is far too excessive and prevents this being a realistically useful app. QR scan reading is prone to fail. Full SD card access is an invasion to privacy - it should not have this permission. Sorry but I don't trust this to not be abused.	2

Have raise this as a feature request with your support team since June, however till now nothing is improved. Appreciate the works of Govtech, however the various Covid 19 apps are compulsory for some sector and it is important for it to work on across all devices. This issue is being shared extensively in various forums. Kindly listen to the feedback and not just bury it.	2
5494	I had to install it on the insistence by airport security. I uninstalled it at the earliest I could. Recently even judges are asking convicts on bail to install this app. I don't buy the justification from the app developers that the app needs to be used for the good of my family. Let me freely choose, if you still agree to the concept of free will of a law abiding citizen. Don't use your CISF muscle power to get me install it and use it.	1

5528	Can't get the OTP... How to install! The developer state the Huawei Mate 30 cause it. But my bank app have been in mate 30 using OTP got not problem. So... If you want this app as only one app. It is no a good app, key reason is Bluetooth is on even you kill off the app when you are at home. It don't make sense at all to on bluetooth when you are at home!. I will go for the QR scanner better. Plus check out the covid active area will do.	2
5529	Works away well on the phone, app has improved since it's breaking down more data to give a better impression of how things are going. Doesn't log location, instead relying on bluetooth connections and randomly generated ids to figure out close contacts so no worries in terms of personal data collection.	0

5549	Great app! I'd give it a 5-star rating but it seems that this app sometimes drains the phone's battery. Also, the main page (with the national stats) are not updated once you open the app. You'll have to switch to another page first and go back to see it updated.	0

5555	EDITED After downloading this app I could no longer access a number of other apps, including for banking and papers. Had to uninstall. Happy to reinstall if this is fixed. Gave 3 stars as I think this is a good initiative but I can't have it installed due to these other issues. Suspect the issues are due to a work required app which I'm aware affects some other settings etc.	2
5556	The App does not work on my phone. Google Play says "installed " but went no further than that. I am not able to enter my details. USELESS	2

5692	After trying and failing a million times with no luck to register, turning off my wifi meant I could verify my mobile number without issue. A glitch for sure, but happy to have found a way to get past it.

5693	Nice	0
5694	Uninstalled. Bluetooth worked intermittently, battery drained in less than 4 hours and the latest update kept asking me to key in my NRIC so after 5 attempts, I gave up and uninstall. Will install again when the program allows me to...lol. Bluetooth now works fine and battery life is great.	2
5695	Trying to do my bit but the app says my mobile number is invalid. Good work Australian government another tech fail.	2
5696	good apps	0
5697	The data provided within the app isn't necessarily useful. There is a county by county breakdown, showing *total* number *since the beginning* of the pandemic. At this point these numbers provide no useful information, instead 14 day averages or five day averages, per 100K population should be shown, as these would give residents an indication of how their area is faring. In addition, the breakdown could be done on a council basis.	1

5708	App keeps telling me that Bluetooth is off even though it is switched on and active. My other Bluetooth devices are working fine, so it isn\u2019t a phone problem. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app to no avail.	2
5709	Seemed fine when first installed but in the last day or two it's completely draining the battery. Having to force stop it which defeats the purpose of the app.	1
5710	Samsungm30s. After last update 8.0.2, the app not working. Reinstalled but after asking for permissins, start page crashes. Showing message APP NOT RESPONDING.	2
5711	This app didn't show I-10 cases cause of to many cases I-10 is locked and this didn't show any single case in I-10. This is rediculous. You have to update this thing otherwise this app is just a garbage.	2

5719	The QR scanning doesn't work for me. I've tried multiple locations and it always says that it isn't a recognised Safe entry QR code. And the feedback/contact us doesn't work either. So hence my review here. Can't be a phone issue. Singpass and the phone's built in scanner works fine.	2
5720	Tedious waste of time, why not use the already present qr code scan or ID card instead of this useless app. I want to remain private and that choice should be respected not forced upon by a bunch of fools who don't have an ID scanner	2

Who are developing this apps must understand if most mobile in qatar still using old version of software. Don't make difficulties to resident if really goverment want to implementing this program againts the virus. Everyone must get easier access to grant this Ehteraz application.

5752	I am deleting. Obviously there is no danger any more if our governments are willing to allow 30,000 to gather for a protest. If anyone contracts the virus because of this, then they should sue the organisers and the government. I know I will. Maybe I'll organise a protest at the MCG next Thursday night, and see how quickly I am fined. Guess what....my life matters too. Dumbarses.	1

5832	If you use Media Volume Sync, so that the phone remembers the volume level for BT connected devices and a separate volume level for wired headphones, the covidsafe app will switch volumes between the BT level and the wired level when it handshakes with another covidsafe app. This has proved to me that the app cannot measure distance as my volume level changes when people walk by my house (at least 5 metres away from where I am sitting). Since the update, this issue has increased in frequency.	1
5833	Very slow application.when I open this application, then this application become hang.	1
5834	I've entered my phone number with the zero and without the zero at the beginning both ways say invalid phone number. Why????	2
5835	I using Huawei 30proSometimes it will auto off and I will on it back again Manuel m	2
5836	Its always connected and followed the covid rate	0
5837	Phone battery runs down quicker with the bluetooth constantly scanning. They should put some code in for your home location and a switch so it turns the bluetooth function in the app (just in the app) on and off when you leave and arrive to your home location. Have capability for 2 home locations for kids in a shared care situation. This may save some battery.	1

5840	No crashes. Set up an account, allow it to run in the background and forget about it until things get back to normal.	2
5841	Why this app needs root permission? I didn't see any explanation about it in the terms of use page.	2
5842	Not able to download the App. Its reflecting a blank screen. Did covid test test yesterday but result still awaited.	2

5897	Breaks my phone. As soon as I install this app my Apps can no longer update from the Play Store, Bluetooth stops functioning (often stops devices connecting via Bluetooth, stuttering and performance issues when they do connect), and tanks my battery. No point in having the app if it makes my phone unusable. Contacted the devs about this, never got a response and app still not fixed. If the Gov expects everyone to be running this they need to fix the issues.	1
5898	Keeps Stopping. Even after granting all permissions, almost a year, and millions of dollars.	2
5899	Improvement - Restriction: You cannot SafeEntry Check-In the same location multiple times - Don't hide the location where I check-in (Example: I check in into a mall and a shop, one of the location would be hiding) Thanks :)	2

5945	Very well designed app, love it and its intent, no issues and uses only 0.5% battery past 3 days. 5***** from me all Aussies should install it.	0
5946	The app does not seem to work correctly unless automatic battery optimisation is switched to manually allow app to run in background. Settings -> Battery -> App launch -> StopCOVID NI. Might also be under Applications -> StopCOVID NI -> Battery Optimisation depending on version. Once I switched this I went from 5 checks over 10 days to 8 checks in a single day.	1
5947	It's not even opening.	1
5948	My location "Downings' in Donegal is not a location on this app. Downings is a highly populated place at the minute because it is a tourist location. How am I meant to know if someone near me has Covid if my town isn't even on the map? Useless.	1
5949	I have tried to do the right thing but having to have location on whenever I leave the house is causing problems with other apps and I'm so fed up with changing location permissions only to have them mysteriously change themselves back every time I restart my phone. I'm now being bombarded with ads for places I've walked past (not visited) and I can't seem to get rid of them. Never had this problem before installing covidsafe.	2

5955	Definitely helpful app. The ease of scanning is much easier compared to Singpass app. However, it will be great if we are able to check in for multiple persons in our family as well (as offered in Singpass). Additionally, the battery usage of the app is increasing. In a matter of 3 hours, my battery capacity is down more than 10%, without even using the phone. Upon checking, the trace together app is the one consuming all the power. I can provide the screenshots if you need. Thanks.	0
5956	Keeps switching itself off, won't work if battery saver is on and then drains my battery. Basically useless app	1

Please make it half an hour and also if someone is infected and it is shown on my mobile then how I may knew it is my relative or my friend or any stranger	0
5961	Staying with a covid positive person. Still it says you are safe. It's one of the best examples of trash app.	1
5962	Bluetooth issues on android device, have found that the app is causing my Bluetooth to drop in and out for a split second at a time, very annoying. Re-installed 4 months later, disappointing that problem still has not been fixed.	1
5963	Many phones are not compatible with this app! 3 out of 4 phones we tried to download this app are not compatible.....because they are too old! We have lost confidence in this app doing what's been promised to because not enough people will have it!	1
5964	Easy	0
5965	The verification code does not get sent to me. Attempted 26 times so far	2
5966	Keep crashing bluetooth app (user might experience this as bluetooth app rebooting), resulting in frequent reconnections to other bluetooth devices. Fix it or you will see more pp force stop the app after checking in, defeating the purpose of contact tracing.	2
5967	I m facing issues.. Coperate. Please	1
5968	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

There is no ability to manually add a location that does not have a QR code. \n\nAs a result this app is useless & will likely delete. Poor execution, I’m afraid. \n\nYou either need buy in by NZ wide business, or an ability of users to fill in gaps manually.\n\nIt would also be good to be able to review own movement history, so gaps can be filled in.	2

6138	I have been using the app since early on,and have it had any problems with it at all. It is so convenient for the exemption certificate, keeps your info so you don't continuously have to type the obvious info in. No notifications thankfully yet, but I am hoping it is being effective!	0
6139	No cases linked using the app, what's the point if it's going to kill my battery everyday. I'll re-download it if it's proven to be a help	1

6146	error came out saying that my NRIC number is invalid, Im a Singapore Citizen but seeing this kind of error pop-out makes me feel like in illegal here. Feel so sad so im giving this useless app 1 star.	2
6147	Took me 3 days to get out to download. Kept saying my phone number was wrong. Now that I have it, I turned Bluetooth on but it keeps flashing on and off. I've tried deleting app and reloading it several times. Does anyone have this problem?	2

6159	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
6160	When you finally reply to my emails just let me know when you fix the app. No customer service at all. Have been trying for nearly two weeks to get in touch with someone. If only we could rate zero stars....	1

6220	I found this app very useful with no issues.	0
6221	Wowow.... network failed and poor bug.... I pefer go back to website easy verify than this	2
6222	I was advised to upgrade the app. I did so. However, the problem still persists. I have sent a few emails already. The scanner would not allow me to scan any Safe Entry at shops or malls. I had to return to using good old Singpass to get Safe Entry...otherwise I wouldn't get in.	2

6251	Once I installed it affected the way all my other phone apps run. I had to uninstall to get my Bluetooth with the car working properly again all though I still have issues, suddenly all my banking apps are no longer working. One app shouldn't cause these problems but it only started once I installed the app.	1

6260	Registration is easy. For those complaining, didn't you read that you need to register after 6pm?? As for dropping the "0", that's the standard way of entering a mobile number using the international format. It's a wonder some can answer their phone!	0
6261	Good	0
6262	I know it is 1st version so some stuff might not work properly but the draining of the phone battery that's an issue need to be well considred else ppl will remove the app to keep her phone working longer	1

6278	excellent	0
6279	The App is only interruption. All times notifying and opting out not easy. So let it go of easy and active when accessing. Make ways that are simple and better for the users	1
6280	I've install this apps since yesterday but there's pop up msgs error in entering mobile number till today. Will it be fix soon?	2
6281	Works really well, haven't seen a single bat since activating! \ud83d\udc4d Jokes aside, the ability to track and trace the virus is a very clever and worthwhile use of technology, this will definitely save lives. I really don't think this app would exploit anyone's privacy considering most people willingly give up all of their privacy everyday on social media. Everyone should get onboard.	0
6282	Does seem to drain the battery a little more than usual but at least on my phone (Pixel 3) it does not cause issues with Bluetooth connectivity to other devices. I have a smart watch and listen to music on a bluetooth headset regularly and it all works fine. I'm also satisfied with the security measures taken by the Department of Health. I know they take people's privacy very seriously.	1
6283	I phone 6 not support \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21	2
6284	It's good but now I have log in problem.	2
6285	Easy to set-up, doesn't drain battery, does not have gas tracking like sheep believe. Seriously if you are an Australian citizen download the app. If the government wants your details there are other means..	0
6286	Why keep the app closing when my phone had update	2
6287	This app is very helpful. However there is a delay getting the results. If that could be improved. It would be great.	0
6288	Constantly indicates location not registering.	2
6289	I cant register	2
6290	This app could be even more helpful if it were to have a functionality to manually (or automatically) track the places and people you have been in contact with. This can be done maybe with notes or daily questionnaire or daily schedule import- so if you get infected you have a better overview of the people you have been in close contact and are able to notify them. This app can be useful, only problem is that bluetooth drains the battery a lot.	2

6306	Unable to install latest version. Previous versions caused every other update to fail due to no connection.	1
6307	Confirmed cases are not showings on map. Only few casses are showing it is not updating location. Only numbers. Useless.	2
6308	This app is the best thing i have ever seen. It supports most devices. it doesn't install on my device. that's why i love it so much, it's so trash i love it. You thing it would be compatible with all devices, but that's why your wrong.I have a Samsung yet the app isn't compatible with my phone. As the Department of Health states that "The COVIDSafe app is part of our work to slow the spread of COVID-19. Having confidence we can find and contain outbreaks quickly will mean governments can ease restrictions while still keeping Australians safe." How can i slow this without the app? Do i go to everyone i see and that comes in range of me and say hay whats your name and phone number because that is not weird. so i can contact them all? Another thing the Government said was "The new COVIDSafe app is completely voluntary. Downloading the app is something you can do to protect you, your family and friends and save the lives of other Australians. The more Australians connect to the COVIDSafe app, the quicker we can find the virus." Yet i fail to see how by not having the app helps. congrats to the Australian government for a incompatible app on many peoples smart devices. :)	0

6345	Just wanted to make sure that the app is safe as I installed it less then 24 hours ago and got a call from +88 number I presumed it was scam call and rejected it. I have not got calls from country unknown to my travel or relations in many years and I am very careful where I give my number if at all.	0
6346	How can a mandatory app not work!?!? I have two flights due in 2 days, one is international from London to Istanbul so no problem there but my second flight is domestic. I can't travel without this stupid EHS code. Phone numbers outside of Turkish numbers doesn't receive any SMS code. Totally disappointed in Turkey once again!	1
6347	This really needs to work together with Finnish corona app. Often travelling from one country to another and staying there for weeks, even months. Switching apps might miss potential infection notification because the app stops working when switching to another corona app (confirmed by support. Would be great if the app would still be able to receive infection notification (eg. for 5 days at least) even if another app is chosen for corona app)	2

6357	Please update your application. And corona patient number attach with gps map. So your app may be useful. And show also red, green or yellow zone patient wise.	2
6358	After update app stop working .	2
6359	I have uninstalled the app because its messing with bluetooth on my phone causing my wireless headphones to constantly cut in and out. I have noticed that many others have complained about the same issue. Until its fixed, i will not be installing this app on my phone.	1
6360	Otp not valid	2
6361	Doubtful it works, it only does a check when you go in and prompt it, I had zero checks for 14 days on a few occasions. I have the app on 3 devices in the same house and they have never had a handshake with each other.	1
6362	Instead of criticizing each little or great effort authorities make to keep folks safe, be proactive, use the app and do your bit for Covid 19	2
6363	Nice	0
6364	My first impression is very positive. One thing I believe needs amending is where it says 'has a health official asked you to upload your data' the first button should have a 'yes' or 'no' answer. If you press 'yes' then it takes you to next permissions page otherwise a 'no' response will tell you that no further action is required. Update: Told u so! There are now members of the public that think they now have COVID-19 because they pressed the 'upload data' & the consent backed up their fears.	0
6365	Good app as it makes checking in and out convenient but for group check in function, I wish we can delete. At the moment if you add a person by mistake it has no delete option at all.	0

6373	Edit: Recent update requires GPS to be on in order to function. Other apps don't need this.	2
6374	Honestly after downloading this app With the bluetooth all my bluetooth Headsets and earpiece were badly affected It always stop the music or the video like it lags there	2
6375	The app doesn't update properly, lately it has given me the numbers from July and August. Today it's stuck on the 24th of December. I was hopeful about this app initially but not anymore.	2

6387	My experience for this app is minus 5. From afternoon around 1pm it disconnected 7 to 8 times even the log in was gone! When developer asked me what is wrong with the app there ain't an error code nor message! Anyway for those that have this issue like me do get your tracetogether token for just in case.	1
6388	Battery saps very fast because Bluetooth have to be on all the time for the app to work. Why not use GPS signal instead? Or Wifi.	2
6389	Was easy to install. But I have some suggestions. 1. Auto activation in time and day. Example: I work every weekday from 08.00 till 16.00. Auto activate in these times. 2. When I'm at home I'm connected to my home wifi network. When I leave home this network is lost and I go to mobile date. This connection lost gives a notification with requesting to activate the tracing. 3. Choose your own language no Mather what system languege you have. 4. Notification on lock screen and on top of screen.	2

6391	I have not been able to finish setting up (entering personal data etc) after updating the app recently and even after uninstalling and reinstalling it (can't even get OTP). It says there's network issue.	2

6397	This app is useless, drains the battery and isn't an all island coverage. Like throwing a plaster on a leak in the bath.	1
6398	Practically this app will just notify us if we are on the red zone, however, it wont prevent us to go to red zone, we dont know where the red zone is, etc.. So i think this app is not so useful, but thanks for the effort	1
6399	The app needs to have the option to send out automatically reminders	0
6400	Excellent App.	0

6404	Very poor app,from last one week showing Ted question mark,tried calling 109 but even after following instruction it's not working ...	1
6405	Have iPhone X.  It drain the battery within 8 hours. Usually my phone battery never dies until next day. Had to uninstall it.	1
6406	The app works fine however I would appreciate it having a dark mode or something similar if possible. As someone who had been using SingPass, the dark theme was something I had been using	0
6407	Would be better if can incorporate checking in with family function like in singpass. Otherwise still no incentive to the safe entry function in TT	2

6418	There is no code for Russian sim card. And how I suppose to buy tickets outside of Turkey?	2
6419	Hi. I've had to remove the app as it was causing my battery to run down and heat up. Only happened recently after I applied an update to my phone OS from Samsung. Am going to try and reinstall to see if it will work again, but not a happy bunny... ??	1
6420	Smartest tool. Because we need as many tools to protect and inhibit the spread of the virus.	0
6421	When it worked it was good. Had to remove it as it drained the battery and phone was burning up constantly.	1
6422	The QR scanner doesn't work on my Huawei Mate 30 pro, it show I need to update on Google play but is ady updated. This app is harder to use compare to other QR code scanner. Not useful at all and more troublesome.	2
6423	Worst app. No authenticity	1
6424	Absolutely drains my battery on my A7, I can maybe get 1.5 days out of it with little use. But since this went on its flat by about 7pm. Wife has an A5 and it drains hers too.	1
6425	Good	0
6426	Still draining my battery, deleting again, will download when it's not so draining. Edit. Works as I would have expected now. No battery drain. Would stil like more info on numbers clusters and location of positive cases.	1

6443	So far it isn't doing me any good. I got a warning saying about a risky encounter. And it's been months since I don't go outside. So it is simply not possible I spent 15 minutes less than 2m close to somebody. So, probably a neighbor. So what? Do I get tested? I don't need an app to tell me to contact my doctor if I experience any symptom. Unless all those notified get tested after the "risky encounter", I don't see much the point of the app.	1
6444	Need more people to download so it's useful	2
6445	It shows your number is not registered and shows two mobile numbers I have never seen, Coustomer care is not useful at all.	0
6446	Easy to use and doesn't really consume battery noticeably.	0
6447	This app is good in theory but it's got a problem when I'm listening to music with Bluetooth it will cut my music out now and then like a really weak signal unless this is fixed soon probs gonna uninstall	0
6448	great	0
6449	Good	0
6450	Just a scam to grab user info and sell it to corporate	1
6451	Had this app for about a week.. Phone got almost red hot few days ago, battery died in 30 min after full charge...yesterday morning heard on a radio that this app does that...wiped phone after...now my battery charges only up to 68% . App destroyed my battery.	1

6458	Unable to face check in after the recent app update	2
6459	Useful app	1
6460	Too much invasion of privacy even if for the sake of my safety.	1
6461	I'm starting to regret installing this app in the first place; ever since I set up my account, the music I'm listening to via either my Bluetooth earbuds or my BT speaker becomes laggy or gets cut off several times (even if I'm just listening to one song on continuous loop). To top it off, it's literally killing my Samsung Galaxy A8 Star's battery life to the point where I have to recharge it 3 times a day as opposed to only every night previously.	2
6462	Doesn't even work bro.......	2
6463	Seems well made. Very well done from a privacy perspective. If a lot of people install this it will really help.	0
6464	Excellent I feel Covid Safe now	0
6465	The 'Sign up' option is not working. Neither i can register nor my father. Kindly fix the problem. Thank you.	2
6466	Why the red pins are not showing after the upgrade ?	2
6467	When I open the app it is in green code color but suddenly it turns into a question mark. So I searched how to fixed it then i follow the instructions like clearing the data and cache, the force stop and the uninstall, reinstall but didn't work. Until the app told me that I exceed the log in attemp and call. But until now its not working. Can you please fix your app urgently because it is mandatory to have this.	2
6468	I tried to sign up for the app, however it did not work. First, I was asked to validate my name, then I was asked to validate my NRIC. So I don't know what else I can do from there.	2
6469	Why not open my Ehteraz	2

6488	Helpful	0
6489	A well designed app that only collects the minimal data required if you choose to submit it. Set it up, leave Bluetooth on, and forget about it. I've had no issues with Bluetooth connectivity interruptions or battery drain. All good. Galaxy S9+ running up-to-date Android 10.	2
6490	Very helpful	0
6491	This app has error while signing up the account as visitor gulf, it says "something went wrong error" and it also has disabled "nationality select box" kindly review it and fix it ASAP	2

6495	I tap on register to see the map and also to get my HES code but the app absolutely does not react as if the register button has no functionality.	2
6496	Very slow. Jams a lot	1
6497	Good effort, but such bad methods. Keep my bluetooth on till the end of outbreak?! Even if I'm quarantined it won't make sense either. Can you find a better way.	2
6498	Always working	0
6499	I dont know what you have done with the latest update, but it has destroyed my battery power. I left the house for 3 hours for study and my phone died before returning home. Charged my phone to the same level when I got home with the app off and I only lost 2% battery power in the same amount of time. Useless if your phone dies while you're still out :/	1
6500	The idea of developing this app for public concern is good , but while implementing any application for public purpose, kindly look into all the possibilities of using app by the citizens without any hindrances, asof now the many citizens including me can't able to register the application becoz they are asking QID and it's expiry date, as I am on family visit visa I have my passport and visa ..it's my request kindly make an option in the app of putting passport number and it's expiry	0
6501	I have to often reset my android device and I suspect that every time I'm getting a new identifier. I don't know how feasible it's to add functionality of restoring an identifier from the cloud backup, but it would be awesome. Thank you.	0

6506	Load of nonsense, nobody updates how they feel daily about the made up bullsh it covid 19, This app is an absolute joke, do not download drains your battery, nobody cares, MW2019 was trash, still no MW2R multiplayer coming, Joe cecot is a pos.	1
6507	Assuming it's working it's a great app, you don't have to do anything. Just have it running. However some way to know its working would be nice. Even just a counter of how many other apps it's discovered in that day, just to know its doing something.	1
6508	Works as intended. No battery drain, no interference with Bluetooth. Unobtrusive despite the constant notification banner.	0

6514	Cant see any result...... still its working or not?	1
6515	Speed up the Safe Entry scan process, after scanning the QR code, it will take a relatively long time to load the check in option	2
6516	Troublesome, and the person who give this idea to use this app should just die. Just use safe entry can already! Why need this app. Waste of government resources and people's money. The idea is to track every individual travel and behavior patterns then sell this information to the government right? Stupid app which i won support.	1
6517	app isn’t even working. no sms otp sent.	2
6518	Not providing the permit. Only showing the message "Something went wrong, please try again later". Please fix this issue urgently.....	1
6519	I found that the app is old vision after download. No improvement.	2

6525	This app is a helpful for all Bangladeshi people. Thanks ICT ministry.	0
6526	A great app for business tracing. Would it be possible to add a QR generator bit so that you can scan the QR code of a personal contact and track when you were with them? It’s hard to remember otherwise.	0
6527	Please bring back the feature to search for locations and check in like how it's done on the SingPass app. This will speed up entry instead of making everyone cluster together to scan the QR code.	2
6528	Good app	0
6529	Connection to other bluetooth devices drops periodically	2
6530	Pathetic.	1
6531	Waste of batteries. Dont like this at all. Qr code scan already bad enough at most area. Now this. Might as well dont go work.stay at home till all over. I not support anything like this at all.	1
6532	Why to launch if it is trial version and doesn't allow registration???	1
6533	There should be a way to use the app without bluetooth. When I use bluetooth my battery wont last even half a day.... And when I shut it off it lasts for 3 days! So please think of an alternative way (gps or sth) to use the app... At the moment I can not use it because I can not charge my phone in the middle of the day.	2
6534	I have Android 10 and unable to set it up. I could download the app, but it crashes and doesn't allow to set up my profile When will the upgrade come for Android 10 Developer-Kindly provide solution asap	2
6535	Great idea.	0
6536	Excellent App	0
6537	App interferes with other bluetooth devices like my ear buds. The disruption is pretty bad where it distorts my music every few secs. My ear buds works perfectly and everything goes back to normal once I pause the app.	2
6538	Thought it would show areas that have cases etc so public can stay away waste of time plus constant GPS and Bluetooth pinging id rather my battery then this the website has more info	2
6539	Haven't used it yet but it's not allowing me to fix or update my flight details and also missing a contact section	2
6540	Today after updating software of my Samsung mobile,Ehteraz started showing big interrogation sign same as mamy users are sharing their experience in comments.I uninstalled and installed the apps again following the guidelines of MOI as given in response to the comments of affected users.	2
6541	Very good app. Pls make the use of this app mandatory when entering all public places, shops, malls, work places etc by employing security checks at the entrances. Add one more colour option to indicate if the user device had not synchronized with the server for a long period of time.	0
6542	Very good but consuming alot of battery	1

6559	Has been fine until now but have started getting warnings about battery and processor usage by the app in the last 24 hours. It's noticably draining the battery life even after restarting the phone. Will have to uninstall if it doesn't improve which defeats the purpose of the app!	1
6560	This is a generally good application, but there are issues with the push notifications for check-in photos. I've called 444 several times to escalate this concern. Keep up the good work!	0

6569	Update 12/08 Oh goody, you added location tracking, eating into my battery life even further \ud83d\ude44 Would be better if it didn't chew through my battery life. Also while the 'oh no your bluetooth is off!' Warning is cute, it's annoying. Turning off my Bluetooth when at home because I prefer to only charge my phone once a day	1
6570	I just have to say, this is a great application and I am glad the government has taken the steps to ensure our privacy while also doing contact tracing.\n\n10/10!	0
6571	My school told me to install this application, but I have to translate everything, please add at least an English version, it would be quite helpful, and a common main priority.	2

6579	Pathetic..all my other apps are workin fine as i have 4G+ network...yet message says ''check internet connection'' when i try to log in to the fiji care app...	2
6580	Could be better. Why is it not possible to select text to copy it to, for example, translate the news items in Google Translate? Are only French speakers expected to catch Corona in France? Yes, I can read the French but like to confirm my understanding. And functionally, if I want to disconnect my Bluetooth headset, it is complicated and easier to turn Bluetooth off. But then when I turn it on again, often I have to restart the 'phone to use TousAntiCovid.	2

6632	Honestly very concerned with the accuracy and reliability of this app, particularly in reference to how how regularly it checks for exposure. Upon receiving weekly notifications regarding my exposure, I notice regularly that the last check hasn't occurred in days. On instances where I have been socialising I have noticed that 0 checks had occurred on these days while checks do seem to occur when I'm in bed sleeping... Very concerned with accuracy and regularity of checking for exposure .	2

6641	The TraceTogether app drains my battery very quickly since the time I have downloaded it and turned on my Bluetooth for it. So I cannot really use my phone much because of the fast battery draining. So I don't understand the reason why I must download the app name hence I gave it no star.	1

At the bottom of the list of notifications there is a blank white bar where the excess/overflow notification icons goes. Not sure how else to explain it but if I disable COVIDSafe the problem goes away so it's definitely a problem with the app.	1
6649	Wont validate my ic number.	2
6650	Cool app hope it will help in the tracing! Love the fact that SafeEntry has been integrated in the app.	0
6651	Couldn't get the logic of this app . Is Bluetooth working as testing kit here ?	0
6652	App won't work on either of our phones only on pad which is always at home	2
6653	Good response	0
6654	Thanks for keeping us safe! No tin foil hat here	0
6655	No tracing in republic! Only one app allowed to inform you of possible contact! Why does this not mesh with the republics app as we cross the border all the time.?	2
6656	I installed this thinking it would help to keep me informed and serve as a medium to see my test results when I got tested last week. However, the nurse who tested me told me that the code provided by the app was useless and that I would have to contact my doctor to find out what the results of the test were. I hope this system will improve as it discourages people from getting tested.	2
6657	Good app	0
6658	I liked the app, it is simple and does provide the necessary information. One thing that needs to be fixed is the notifications for the daily photo requests.. I am not getting the notification and missing to upload them most of the times. Also it would be great to see the date and expected time of self-isolation end test and instructions. Thanks for the good work!	0
6659	Please make it compulsory to use on public transport, public places, cafes, shops, etc. E.g. currently, people are using one common pen when leaving their details in cafes, etc. Not safe. Should be touchless like this app.	0
6660	Excellent	0
6661	Buggy app. Your 971**** is not registered. Please register using 971***366. I don't have that number they want.	2

6666	I already wear a mask and all but having this app tell me if I'm safe or not -- just simply, thank goodness for that.	0
6667	I can't activate the app	2
6668	Found the issue why I'm unable to progress with the NRIC registration. The app is not backward compatible with existing users. I need to uninstall and reinstall before it works.	2
6669	I have downloaded the app and it seems not to be working. Another thing is it asks access to my gallery, how is that connected to covid 19	1
6670	I like the app it just is sucking battery power even when I’m home alone.	1

6678	Fudddu app	1
6679	Recently started to require all sorts of additional information (and phone permissions), with no good reason why stated. Includes full name, DOB, NRIC, etc. Defeats the initial intention and purpose of "lightweight"/"minimum info" tracing. Feels like full blown surveillance. Uninstalled for that reason. Such a shame.	2
6680	Good	0
6681	Why after updated required to uninstall the old one and I became no valid?!!! Please fix it	2
6682	A big FU to the Liberty Australia and everyone else who thinks this app was a bad idea. We care about our safety. You are leeches and lawyers	0
6683	The information is not accurate, my sister scanned the app on her phone and it shows that there are 3 confirmed cases in our area (5 meters away) and when I scanned the app in my phone, it shows 0 result.	1
6684	V.good	0
6685	Great concept but won't recognize my number.	2
6686	I downloaded the app, but very frustrated that it didn't work on my mobile. I don't know the reason, probably it require certain version.	2
6687	Very good app needed for the deconfinement, every good citizen must download this app'. Must be improved with a tdlr.	0
6688	Every time I try to install this app it's shows network connection problem please fix this problem	2
6689	BS app and does nothing	1
6690	I like how the security has been implemented to maintain privacy yet get the job done. Well done!	0
6691	Down loaded and it said successfully but theres no shortcut on screen and it seems to have disappeared	2
6692	The pause function is good. But only 3 choices on the duration If can improve or revamp to this part, i think the take ip rate will be even better. As majority are still encourage to Work from Home ( WFH), so the app is useful only when we step out of our home, and should be turn off when we are home. Dont your agree? So can consider having a simpler "turn on/ turn off button".. And just remind user when we go out, turn it on, just like we put on mask only when we go out of house.. Cheers	2
6693	How is this app hard to find? If you type in the title of the app, StopCOVID NI there it is. Hardly rocket science!	0
6694	this app why demand for bluetooth and location on after that show you'r result mean take time if you have low data not show you'r result. \ud83d\udcaf'/, not perfect app .	2

6698	Drains the battery of my cellphone, keeps sending me update notifications through ehtreraz itself not through google play, I do the updates and still I recieve the updates again and again. Sill it is not clear at what proximity it collects data via bluetooth.	1
6699	Had the same battery issue but Clearing Storage in Google Play Services, rebooting the phone and the enabling Contact Tracing in the Covid19 app solves the problem. You will also have to enable Phone Backup again (if used) as this will have been disabled by clearing storage in Google Play Services. Hope this helps. Battery drain for a few days is better than lockdown for weeks.	1

6705	This is very good and useful. It has helped me a lot in this situation of pandemic. It informs us if we come in contact with a Corona positive person. It gives details about the current Covid-19 status and the number of people near me affected by Corona. This app is extremely user-friendly. Thank for creating this app. I'll recommend it to other.	0

6713	Useless app if you're the only one using it since it only works by able to detect users with the app and bluetooth on. Good initiative but too little people are downloading it. Drains battery super fast, push notification fine as it does show its working. Decent app but rendered useless due to lack of users.	1

6726	Issue about bluetooth. I'm starting to see issues about my bluetooth devices cutting out and even dropping connections sometimes. Battery usage has slighty increased. Other than these issues, everything is fine and would you bring dark mode back? Edit: Bluetooth connectivity of my devices are having intermittent drops here and there. No improvement for bluetooth stability at all. Each update is getting worse	2
6727	Keeps saying my mobile number is invalid. Can't sign up. Tried both ways without the 0 then with the 0 neither worked.	2

6750	I like the qr scanner. It is very fast and accurate. And also the check out/ check in icon that helped me to remember to check out before checking in. But why is it that i cannot download the latest version, 2.4 that allows multiple check in?	2
6751	Tried many times unsuccessfully	1
6752	Why are there two of the exact same app that was useless to begin with	1
6753	Most doctors and labs don't accept the generated test code in the app. Because of this, my screen remains green, eventhough I came into contact with someone who had COVID. A better way should be to provide a fill-in form to add the code provided by the test centre. If positive tests can not be tracked by the app (even if it is due to the unwillingness of the people that collect the tests), it makes this tool redundant.	2
6754	What is the daily update of this application? It's good because the content is always updated, but it's a waste of data if the application is always everyday needed to update.. Hopefully 2-3 weeks before you update your application..	0
6755	The app as a serious problem...After updating the app it's not responding(automatically closing) called 109 several times the line remains busy and getting auto reply as agent call u by 2hrs....It's been 3 days still the issue not fixed	2
6756	Pointless. Can only track people when the contamination has been done and does not help to prevent by checking daily the users on potential symptoms to send teams for proper testing. And that if only a person has decided to be checked. The only outcome is to realise that one person has created a cluster. I does not prevent does not help but selfish people will feel free to go out now because there is an app they can blame one. Pathetic gvt	1

6764	Like a lot of others my hubby and l finding app is draining battery and phone overheating. We were worried something wrong ie.virus, but at least we now know. Defference of opinion between us l feel important to keep Covid tracker as l check in every day and note if Cavan has gone up( 864 less than 2 wks ago and last night 881). Hubby has uninstalled his tracker. Battery drainage and overheating needs to be sorted, quickly otherwise if people keep uninstalling Covid app it will become useless	1

6784	Rubbish, installed on two Samsung Galaxy J4 plus mine ans wifes. Hers work fine, my app download has never worked even when removed and reinstalled.	1
6785	The initiative is commendable and the app's serverless architecture itself is great having used firebase thus enabling the quick rollout. But there has been this bug wherein it affects my Bluetooth earbuds (they keep pausing and playing affecting the quality). I tested it out by force stopping the application and the earbuds worked just fine, restarted the app again and had the same issue. I'm still using the app considering the situation at hand. But would be really great if the bug is fixed.	2
6786	I Love this App, this is the Largest Global Medical Emergency in over a Century! ?? I'll do anything to protect myself and my fellow citizens! ??

6797	For an app that's meant to help protect the community its poorly designed and filled with glitches. After installing it on my s20 I couldn't open any apps without them crashing and my battery drains way too quickly. I ended up uninstalling the app. You would think they would put better design into an app like this. Why do we also need Bluetooth on? Seems silly	1

I'm not aware of any other apps that updated on my phone that day. Great UI/UX. Easy to get started and navigate. Clear explanation text. Would like to be able to expand Daily confirmed cases graph.

6878	Whilst the purpose of this app is fantastic it interferes with the playback of music through Bluetooth headphones or the Bluetooth connection in the car.

6887	Many times when using the safe entry option I get an error saying not a valid QR code. But if I switch to my phone camera it works perfectly. So there is some problem with the QR scanning on some codes. Also many times I scan a code and the app just gets stuck with spinning blue circle. This seems to happen a lot when I've done safe entry once and then do it again for a second place soon after (eg first safe entry is a mall, second safe entry is a shop within the mall). App not really up to standard at the moment because of these problems, and I am sure it's the app only as using phone camera and web-based safe entry works fine.	2

My phone is now back to where it was, giving me just short of two full days on a single charge with normal daily usage. Very happy with the app.	1
6900	App has been causing problems with my bluetooth headphones, it sometimes causes the bluetooth to turn off mysteriously.

6912	Hi there. I understand that the app need to be running in the background. However, I feel that the app is draining excessive power from my phone. Please take a look at this issue and fix it soon but good work on trying to curb the spread using the app.	1
6913	Doesn't work and integrate with androids covid19 exposure notification. Most on iOS too.	2
6914	It dident work well for me.have android phone you put phone number in it sends you a pin back you go to your text messages retrieve it same all over again different pin so gave up.stuff it.	1

6930	Can you please just add a function so I can turn on locations services, so the app can know where I am at all times. I care about privacy and how this information may be used but care more about the practicality of this app. If it could use with the consent of the user, location services it would mean people did not have to log in at every place they visit which I’ll honestly say I don’t	2

6938	HELP. What's happened in the last 2 days to this app? I've had it since launch and it's been fine. Since 7 August it's completely depleting me and my husband's battery in a few mins. Please fix this. I want to use this app!	1
6939	It doesn't give out any information...	2
6940	after app release rate I install this app in my phone and working fine 1/2 day after this daily this app crash and showing unfortunately stop already I allow all access for this app but nowadays I can't login showing exceeded number of activation contact 109, I already call but no response waste of time 10-15 mins call are running tune also, now tell what can do ??

6942	Update app to min android v8 and above so that Bluetooth does not require location. Alternatively, on devices running Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher, you can use the CompanionDeviceManager to perform a scan of nearby companion devices on behalf of your app without requiring the location permission.	2
6943	I went to bed before middle night. When I wake up and check, 24 contact today. Does the data make sense?	2

6951	Keeps glitching my music players, soundcloud and Spotify. Not happy Jan!!!!!! If you want people to use this it can't mess with simple stuff like this. I'm out till it's fixed. (Will keep washing hands and socially distancing)	1

6956	Its a battery drain maybe since last update? I can have a full battery at 2pm then 20% at 4pm when my phone has done nothing. This app is the only one listed as any significant battery drain. Never used to be this way but I have to keep it off. Don't like travelling home at night with no phone.	1

6966	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0
6967	A very helpful app! Only works if you are chosen as one of the first groups to register through a text message received. I'm lucky to one of them! Hopefully, this will be a successful app and can help all of us here in KSA.	0
6968	It's a newly released app, it won't show on searches for 24 hours likely, dependant on Google play. Not app developers fault. Stay Safe.	1
6969	Good	0
6970	I don't understand why the app needs access to my personal files, Bluetooth all the time?	1
6971	My wife is trying to install and register on the app and in spite of entering all the correct details, it continues to tell her that the details entered are incorrect. Complete waste of people's time.	2
6972	App won't allow me in "invalid phone number" dropped the first 0?	2
6973	Just like everyone else who has reported, my phone started to get hot and the app started to drain battery. Had 100% battery within 30 minutes lost 35% , forcefully stopped the app and the phone started to cool down and battery life recovered. Not sure to what happened , it was working fine until now ..	1
6974	Installed successfully but not opening Need help	2
6975	Killing my battery in the last 2 days if this keeps up I'll have to uninstall it 3 times yesterday i had to recharge my battery where as it would normally last nearly a full day.	1
6976	Version 2.3.10 solved zero BT tracking and tracing problems.	2
6977	This app keep interupt my other bluetooth connection such as speaker, ear phone, etc.	2
6978	App does not state the time or location of when you were exposed to someone with covid. This makes it difficult to know which people should be notified of your exposure and which people could not have been affected by your exposure, which renders the app almost useless.	2
6979	Overheats my phone and rapidly drains my battery. I had to uninstall.	1

7001	Worst maintanance, No record is maintained if one tested and confirmed as covid positive with using same mobile in both for testing and login with same mobile number. It would be useful if it is integrated with covid testing data.	1

7032	Why asking for NRIC and date of issue to start using?????? Icon changed to red, which is fine. Revealing too much info in profile. Why do we need a barcode generator for NRIC? Why an option to pause?	2
7033	Can use for non smart phones, Huawei mobile phone and phones that does not have a local singapore number ?	2

7035	Battery consumption more. Need to update application and modifications. User facing problem. App is Great \ud83c\uddf6\ud83c\udde6|	1
7036	Understand that location access is required but not storage and access to making calls. This app is made obligatory on all but labourers and other low budget employees do not own android phones. What about mobile data? Not everyone can afford. All reviews and comments by public should be taken into consideration before the mandate being applied and deadline to download such app was published. Good initiative but needs practical thought.	1
7037	Unfortunately I needed to uninstall it on the first day since it was draining my phone's battery.	2

7040	Have to turn bluetooth off to use wifi for some reason now when at home why I'm not sure. Will forget to turn on/off eventually. Have to allow my location which gives my home address. Been trying to avoid this ever since coroner spolated evidence to cover-up how sister met her end but now this is open info. To what ever gov agency wants location. Born to be hunted. Just don't go wife and kids. Uninstalling as it says location is on while i have it off. And its a battery killer.	1
7041	Drained my phone battery and so useless, I can't believed the government spent that much money for an useless app, this is how you spend tax payers money, poor design and chased nothing, unbelievable	1
7042	The app should be installed to at least 80-90% of the population to be effective. A better publicity campaign and easier to understand privacy explanations might be helpful.	0

7062	There was bug when calling or receive call, screen goes off even hang up phone.	2
7063	Decided to pull the app off my devices. A10 battery stats - app has high battery drain while running in background. I'm not a tech guy, but I'm eliminating apps that suck juice.. On stock Android 9, I had problem. So i decided to use custom ROM on A10 (just before the devs replied, so I couldn't follow up since different OS). When paused, can't even back out of the app which means it's actually in foreground. Play Store says app may not be optimised for my device. I go get token. Stay safe!	1

7075	The Australian Government pushed everyone to install this, but on iOS it was problematic, yet instead of improving it, or pivoting to create a central check-in register, all businesses in Australia adopted disparate approaches for Covid check-in, thereby hampering covid tracing. At the very least they could have indicated it was a waste of time and told people to uninstall.	2

7101	Installed on the first go. No problems there. I have no issues the the surveillance conspiracies. But had to re-rate the app because it interferes with my podcast-to-car connection, and keeps turning off my podcast. So whenever I'm in the car, I have to force-stop the app so I can listen. And so sometimes I forget to turn it back on when I get out of the car.	2
7102	good	0
7103	I've only got the app installed to help do my part. Worst app in the history of all apps - since the install I can't update any existing apps, can't install any new apps, battery life is terrible, Bluetooth connections to headphones etc. are flaky, blue light filter doesn't turn on or off automatically, notifications for apps don't come through properly (but when they do, they come through multiple times). I could go on but I'd run of out space in the review!	1
7104	I have installed the application on my mobile but the application is not opening. You can share any idea of any application developer about this.	2
7105	The screen disappear before entering OTP	2
7106	Worked straight away, registration process worked even before 6pm on 26/04/20. Endorsed by Medical professionals, doesn't use GPS, the protection to myself from others who may get sick and having an early warning for contact tracing weighs heavily for my favour than big brother paranoia.	0

7110	Pointless unfit for purpose shite	1
7111	Simple & private. This app does all its intended for, and from what I can tell by reading the detail, covers my security. If anyone's wondering, no location services are used (though because of android the permission must be granted along with Bluetooth), and only encoded information after "hand-shaking" a known case are you offered to send your information to a server. There is a +61 to adding your phone number, which may seem irritating, but is not too uncommon in a lot of forms these days.	0

But it logged me out even though I didn’t run the update yet. I know I shouldn’t have passwords written down but I simply can’t remember them all and haven’t had time to investigate password apps! Can you stop the app from logging people out - I know it’s happened to others at times too?	2

7256	Really good and easy to use	0
7257	The app causes my music to pause playback every 30-60 seconds when streaming to a speaker or headphones from the phone using bluetooth. It's like the covid safe app needs to borrow the bluetooth connection every time it tries the "electronic handshake". No option to pause the app to overcome the problem so had to completely uninstall. If there was a "pause for 1 hr feature" I would have kept the app. Will reinstall if this is fixed.	2

7298	In latest version 1.0.39, if I disable the location on Android, the logo is green on top left corner, the notification says it's active, but when I open the App itself, it says "COVIDSafe is not active"... Same after rebooting. This is misleading. Please fix this bug.	2

7346	It was great and very handy but last night I got a notification that an app was draining my battery and when I clicked on the notification it told me that it was this app. Since then my phone's battery is literally dying. I don't want to uninstall because of what it does but why have it if my phone is going to turn off anytime I leave the house or have to constantly charge my phone. Is this just my phone or has this got something to do with the app? Never happened before for any app	1
7347	Keeps receiving the message "no internet connection" and citing network issues when both my WiFi and mobile data are ON. Please fix the technical issue.	2
7348	Clean and simple. Explains clearly what it does and how. Can't say (yet) if it works like it should... But that's not the fault of the app necessarily. One minor nitpick: It'd be nice if the language could be selected in the settings.	0
7349	Good thank you	0
7350	Good initiative to aid contact tracing. However, bluetooth audio is disrupted and music playback will be interrupted every 10-15 seconds which is irritating. This is especially relevant in an office setting where users will be on Bluetooth earphones and where tracing is important. Please look into the issue if its resolvable. Battery drain is manageable on a Samsung Note 8.	2
7351	Always turns off and I have to manually restart it. Changed battery settings for the app as required and even tried developer mode. Biggest load of rubbish for 2 million dollars.	1

7383	Every send Day. Asks for OTP.	2
7384	Bluetooth/BTLE technology was not designed as used by the app designers. No coordination with OS vendor Google. Very inefficient design and low compatibility to wide range of Android OS devices . Security and safety has yet to be proven for the app as it has not been peer reviewed by non-Singapore based Security researchers for infosec purposes .	2

7400	Deleted. Huge waste of Aus taxpayer $. Built on lies, corruption & nepotism so offensive to most Australian values/expectations of govt it'd make Machiavelli blush! It's now clear why (despite myriad proven benefits) they so vehemently oppose open source - they've always known it didn't work on locked iPhones + a major dev/support contract went to Delv Pty Ltd (a company with ties to the. Liberal party). Then MP Robert blamed the program's failure on Apple/Google. Criminals.	1

7407	Drains the battery and interferes with other Bluetooth connections (e.g. headphones/speaker constantly cuts in and out as this app scans for other devices). Would be better if this app could be put to sleep manually when not needed, like when at home. I'll give it a bit longer to see if you resolve it, but will need to delete the app if it doesn't improve...	1

7467	I have no problem with this app being secure. But as long as the OS's they are running on are 'not' secure...sorry not using.\n\nHopefully being public about not using this will serve as pressure to cell companies that the simple fact that you 'can' invade anyones cell at any time is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\n\nMap all the legit towers and make that map constantly available to the public and updated. Force phones to use only them and alert user of any deviations and force Apple (at least) to remove network restrictions that prevent VPN's from functioning properly.\n\nThen I'll consider usng this.\n\nExample : iPhone 11 running iOS 13 : Turn off wifi and cell data, disable all system services and send an SMS or try using Signal to send a message...until these and other issues are addressed (inability to disable audio/cameras, etc) count me out. And Stingers, etc? PASS.	1

7480	Be nice if it worked. Despite having the battery optimisation turned off for this app, it keeps coming up "inactive" and telling me to change the setting. I agree and it says active. A few minutes later I get a notification that it's inactive again.	2

7492	For the first time in your life you can help your country significantly by downloading an app. Yes it might drain your battery, but the alternative is the risk of overrunning the medical resources. Both are bad choices , this is the better choice.	0
7493	Downloaded the app. Same issue as many others when it kept telling me the phone number I have had for 25 years is invalid. Tried a dozen times. Just did the same to my wife as well. We have both since uninstalled the app. Your have to be kidding!! I'll think about it long and hard in regards to doing this again at all.	2

7548	Generally don't notice the app running at all; UPDATED - haven't experienced the below for some time now. however started using the phone for music in the car today and it constantly causes the cars Bluetooth to reset about 1-2 minutes into each song. Phone = Samsung S9+ Car = Mazda BT50 2014 (Don't know what version of Bluetooth) Hopefully you can resolve this issue.	1
7549	Good public	0
7550	Still need a way to disable at home rather than a pause.	2
7551	It keeps closing...not very useful when I get home and realise it hasn't been tracking. I make sure I reopen the app every morning but it closes within a couple hours. I have selected the not allowed option within battery optimisation, so it's not due to that. Update: newer updates have fixed this issue	1
7552	Todays update not working properly. Crashes	2
7553	Latest update require gps location to be on but that info is not included in the update or description. Why has this been added? Also it's a big drain on battery.	1

7557	Hi i need help. I have updated the tracetogether app last week, keying in my nric no. But now i have change to a new handphone. When i try to set up again, it said my nric is not valid. What should i do?	2
7558	Update: 20/12/20 Battery drainage is still terrible. Still can login multiple devices with one mobile number. 30/11/20 When I sign in the same number on a new phone, all my Favourites does not port over from the profile/account of the old phone, and all my saved Favourites are gone. And when I sign in the same mobile number on a new phone, the old phone does not auto sign out, meaning I could scan 2 or more different places at the same time, with the multiple same Profile/NRIC.	1
7559	When I do the check in, the number of people logo uses a light green background with white text. Cannot read that from a distance and the ambassador had to come close to read.	2

7563	Good app! Useful. Just one point - there is a type under "I want to Help" page. In the thirda paragraph it says "State ot territory", which should be "State or territory". Just from quality check perspective, no issues as such. Great effort by the government.	0

7597	Took this off my phone due to privacy also i did not like the fact of it requiring bluetooth as it should have nothing to do with tracking a virus who or what does it want me to connect to? Also what has asking permission to my camera, microphone and contacts got to do with it. Final verdict too many shady things going on with this app	2

7600	Not good	1
7601	I have downloaded the app but cant open..any suggestion? Im stuck in entering the mobile number	2
7602	UI is lucrative but user will not drain his mobile battery by keeping bluetooth on for a whole day. Devs should think of a different way to find infected person or area.	2
7603	Second thought. The location issue is bad. However it's not solvable, at least for now. Unlike many here are saying it's not a permission issue. The app doesn't even ask for fine location permission. It's a design decision by google. When an app gets a list of nearby devices (wifi, bt, etc) it could use it to find the actual position of the phone. Therefore if user disables location services from the settings, listing of nearby devices (wifi, bt,..) will be disabled for all apps regardless of permission settings. As a result the covid app which is based on finding nearby and unknown devices, needs location services enabled. Mitigating factors. Try location with battery saving enabled. Disable all notification from the covid app and enable location services only when a lot of people are nearby. Also battery management is problematic. Uninstalled.	1
7604	After update. My phone keep on indicate this app is draining battery	1
7605	Very good app	0

7619	It caused my Bluetooth headphones to stop working correctly. When the Covid app was running, anything playing on the headphones would cut out every 10 seconds or so. Force stopping the Covid app resolved the issue. So the app doesn't work correctly if you want to use it at the same time as using Bluetooth headphones.	1

7622	This app took up my storage and drained my battery, so it's not that helpful to me at all. It was saying on the radios that u should download it so I did, and it wouldn't let me out of the app. I'm very disappointed in this app.	1
7623	I like	0
7624	There is only check in option and no check out option. For MRT will be confusing of when to check out on our first location. And when we reach our destination, no check out option. So we have to check out on our first location and do a check in on our final location and immediately check out on our final location. Not user friendly.	2
7625	I cannot login! It has a major bug! The tracetogether tojen problely will be easier to use	2
7626	A great app! Well built and completely anonymous. I hope enough people will install it. Kudos to Belgium for this!	0
7627	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0

7733	Constant app icon in notifications bar is not helpful and annoying. Should just pop up if the app stops working. I don't need to constantly know whether the app is running. Since close contact requires more than 30 minutes contact. Scan interval can be reduced to help with battery draw. If it kills my phone while I'm out, it also defeats the purpose of the app	2
7734	Update (2020/12/27): at SBST DTL (Hillview)group check-in received message: this venue doesn't allow group check-in. So it only checked in 1 person.	2

7737	Terrible app, keeps interfering with Bluetooth connection to my other devices, doesn't auto update and just in general is a pain to have on my phone.

7744	I got through the otp section. When it comes to the personal information I can't pass through it, it kept saying that birthday is invalid. Who are you to correct me for my birthday?! What a joke. Can you input a section for people who are currently serving NS? I forget my IC issued date.	2

7774	Not at all working. I re installed 40 times... But not showing status... Customer care is helpless. Somebody should fix this bug asap. Cant go anywhere now because of this app bugs	2
7775	Works well except for yes, newer bluetooth transmissions will interfere with app getting location signals. Example: a colleague sends me a document at work through Bluetooth because there is no WiFi or email in the cold freezer. That doc will interrupt and cancel location-tracing signals. In other words, it is not foolproof. Will govt arrest those who switch off their Bluetooth? What abt those working from home in essential services? This does not allow me to give a fuller review.	2
7776	I can't get past are you from NI screen. No options to click!!	1
7777	not good	1
7778	Battery drain fast and phone overheating, Dear team please solve the issue and release update	1
7779	I am going to uninstall this stupid app. It's taking too much battery, my phone can only last half a day. If you want this app mandatory, the you have to consume much lesser battery than now	1

7785	Good and there should be a bell like System in the app so that we know If any corona positive near us. There should be a alert system.	0
7786	It was great and very handy but last night I got a notification that an app was draining my battery and when I clicked on the notification it told me that it was this app. Since then my phone's battery is literally dying. I don't want to uninstall because of what it does but why have it if my phone is going to turn off anytime I leave the house or have to constantly charge my phone. Is this just my phone or has this got something to do with the app? Never happened before for any app	1

7791	Location scan with in 1 km very bad idea no facilities for 200 meter	1
7792	I had some fun getting this installed to begin with.. The app didn't like my mobile phone number, but then I had a sudden brain wave and removed numbers from my user nick name. Then everything was smooth sailing. This app is an incredibly important corner stone of our country's response to COVID 19. The uptake of this app will determine how quickly social distancing restrictions are eased.	2

7805	This app in principle is a brilliant idea. I've had it for nearly a month no issues. In the last week the charge can't fall out of my battery fast enough and its causing my phone to restart a lot. I think other apps are crashing now too. I've had to uninstall it. Please fix and I will try again.	1

7807	The app used to work, but now it's pathetic and useless. I cannot scan anymore. Jt asks to update google services even though I reinstalled it fresh. I would rather use a simple qr now. App had good features with it is not useful for safe entry anymore due to a bug.	1

7838	Issues with Bluetooth headset as this app interfere with headsets. Also battery runs out very quickly due to this app. I tried this on 2 different phones. Same issue hence uninstalled the app.	2
7839	App drains battery too quickly (59% to 53% in 15min of idle) and keeps phone warm when idle on a tabletop. I don't mind helping the government, but not at the expense of my phone's longevity... EDIT: Developer has replied that drain is marginally greater on phones with Bluetooth enabled. But in the first place, your phone's Bluetooth should not be turned on all the time if you you want to save battery!	1

7857	After your recent version update Bluetooth keeps disconnecting with stupid message like did u accidentally disconnect Bluetooth. Listening to Spotify using Bluetooth is an issue now as Bluetooth keeps disconnecting and reconnect, likewise for Apple Watch.  Uninstall the apps solve the issue. If u guys want to hit certain % of usage, solve your Bluetooth issue. Device used is iPhone with iOS 14.2	1
7858	Great idea being that I am on chemo but would be better if I didn't drain my battery kinda need it for calls and texts. I found my phone battery did not last and since I uninstalled the app my phone charger faster and my battery lasts longer. But I wont reinstall my phone is brand new and not burning it out by having this I stick to comin seance keeping my hands clean and wearing a mask in crowed areas	1
7859	Such a pathetic app!!!\nNo information on proximity with contagious person. It gives you only stats. Such a waste of time and money (I suppose). The Council of Ministers should be more careful before relying on such misleading apps. Unless the main purpose is to collect personal data, is it so???!!!	2

7862	My appis not work why please help me	1
7863	Completed useless app! Just made for someone's profit. It just sgow stats around you, for whom officially marked covid. This app doesn't do tracing or any data available to public, nor able to identify anyone with covid or contact with covid. Just made mandatory for the govt to steal private data of people.	1
7864	It's failure	1

7866	Terrible when I get to pin nothing can't be bothered tried numerous times	1
7867	The app looks fine from a technical perspective, but even as an English speaker the implementation of language settings is awful. As per an interview on news.err.ee it seems it is possible to change the language by changing the operating language of the phone. But, first, this seems entirely counter intuitive and is not standard app design on android. Second, this process is not explained anywhere, either on the app, or in the description on the play store (which is also in English!)	0

7872	Not sure how well it works, but it screws up the Bluetooth connectivity with other devices. My earpiece have to be re-paired everytime I want to use it. And most times cannot be done (which never happened before I downloaded this app). Please fix it. Super frustrating!	2
7873	After update. My phone keep on indicate this app is draining battery	1
7874	It need to update. Learn from other corona app made by other country.	2

7877	I've downloaded the app but what now? Do I just wait for the dreaded notification that I've been close to a carrier? How can I be confident that it's working at all? It's a great app but only if I know it's actively workin	1

7882	It drains less than 1% of battery in a charge cycle if you have a modern phone with Bluetooth LE, about 7 times less than Google Chrome even when the latter doesn't use Bluetooth at all. Don't believe what the people with outdated phones say LOL	0

7886	Thanks for creating this app, living with someone who is at higher risk if they were infected it gives greater peace of mind now that we are out a bit more during level 2 lockdown. Good to know that if we are exposed to someone who has been diagnosed with COVID we will find out about it much sooner! Would encourage as many people as possible to download and use it so that it reaches its full potential!	0

7897	Excellent	0
7898	I suggest everybody uninstalls this app. Running my own sw company I cannot see any justification neither for the original budget nor the approved increase from 2m to 5m. Alone for hosting they claim $800k is required. The app is supposedly storing the data on the device not in the cloud, why would cloud hosting cost that much then? Think yourself... This app should never have costed more than 0.5m to 1m.	2
7899	A great idea but have only been able to check in at places with the QR code maybe 3 times since it’s launch.	0

7951	SOLUTION - INVALID PHONE NUMBER - If you get the "invalid phone number" error do the following - 1) Close the app (don't just minimise it) 2) Turn off WIFI 3) Turn off bluetooth 4) Open the app again and follow the instructions. It should work this time. I entered my full mobile number including the leading 0. 5) Turn on WIFI and bluetooth App Developer - hurry up and fix this critical bug!!! It is affecting many thousands if not millions of people.	2

Suggestion could be different colour for state, similar to Dengue in an area idea. Blue for no cases, orange of there is, red if recommended to stay home ect.	0

8000	Nice app, simple and efficient. The QR code scanner is very responsive, I really like that. Two suggestions: 1) - I would like to see something like location based automatic check-out. 2) - widget for easy access.	0

8010	The Gov't had taken a good decision by making this app just to know about the status of the people living in Qatar. But their r some cases where people don't have their Qatar Id cards, becoz when u access the app it asks for Qatar id# and a expiry date than only it starts showing u the status. So humble request to please come up with some solution for it as becoz the Qatar gov't has made it mandatory for every citizens and resident of Qatar to download the app...!!! Hope u answer to query.	0

8024	Had to uninstall due to interference with Bluetooth Headphones. S8+ and Earbuds.	1
8025	Good idea but unfortunately murdered my battery via Bluetooth. Will try to remember to put Bluetooth on when out for essentials.	0
8026	Always crashing	2
8027	Very good initiative by the Govt but, like other users, I'm also experiencing connectivity issues with my Bluetooth earphones after installing this app. Hopefully this can be fixed soon so that we don't have to choose between leaving the app on or having uninterrupted music!	2

8033	I hope its just me. Sometimes randomly I have to briefly turn bluetooth off, to get mt wifi to work again. Then I forget to reactivate bluetooth. Android phone. There is nowhere on the covidsafe website to put technical feedback. No feedback is not really good for quality control. How will you know if its working, until you need it and then its too late.	1
8034	Even though I restart my phone for 100 times, push notification still comes up asking to restart. Please fix this asap	2
8035	Good app	0

8040	Alright, after rectification with the CSOs, the issue has been resolved. A suggestion would be to add a button for a camera scan where automatic *Check In/Out* occurs on camera scan. This is mostly for the older demographics who uses smartphones but are less literate. This autonomous check in/out only requires them to scan the QR code where they can also choose to tap to show the existing NRIC. Better to have more option for them.	2

8045	I give this app five star, because it helping of our health improve.but when I am not in a public places, I should have free choice to turn off my Bluetooth or location because this app designed for public places. so some people have an issue with their phone battery life I hope see those option for the next update free choice.	0
8046	Had to delete the app. It was draining the battery. I'll reinstall it if this issue is rectified.	1
8047	Great idea that I do want to use, and hope everyone will. Problem is that for me, it keeps switching off and not run in the background. Please fix that. I really, really want to use it, to help out. But ... After say a day of running in the background, it switches itself off. Defeats the purpose.	0
8048	It was working fine but after I uninstalled and reinstalled this (v2.4.1), I am stuck at creating profile, it cannot proceed at all. all entry were correct but it always prompt "sorry, were temporary unavailable. please try again later"	2

8067	Every Canadian should download and run this app to help fight the spread of COVID. It will notify you if you have been near someone who has been diagnosed with COVID, assuming they too are using the app. So the more people that use it, the better it will work.

8083	Is a good start for creating this app. However this app force my screen brightness to 0% even I turn off adaptive brightness and manual adjust the brightness to 60%. Is there a way to get around this issue?	2
8084	Too many permissions, why does it need permissions to my pictures, contacts and Bluetooth, data privacy is being violated. It's better if this app only had access to locations and camera and dialer only....poor app	1
8085	Works well, doesn't require unnecessary permissions.	0
8086	Is not working at all in my Samsung 10+. The app is starting but nothing comes to display out off a warning to allow positioning and internet features in order to work, and obviously they were allowed ahead.	2

8092	After downloading we cannot log on to either phone. Have updated the phones, used the phone number without the zero, turned the phones on and off, deleted the app and reinstalled but still can\u2019t get past the phone page. What am I doing wrong??????	2

8128	Had to delete the app, was causing my battery to drain far too quick, was barely getting 4 hours from a full charge where I would usually get 24 hours easily.

8146	7 months into the pandemic and the app still doesn’t work for my area.  It’s not like I live in the Arctic circle, I live in Vancouver.  \nJust another liberal smoke screen to make people think they are doing something when ALL the work has been done by the provinces, unless you count putting the country so far into debt that my grandchildren will suffer for it.\nThe developer keeps responding “this app is national in scope.”  NO IT IS NOT.  You know why? Because it doesn’t work nationally!	1

8183	Only allow users to pause the scanning up to 8 hours... working from home for months and only head out once every week. Have to pause the app on a 8 hour basis to avoid battery drain.	1
8184	It’s a useless piece of government surveillance program. I urge you all not to use it as there is evidence that shows that the App does secretly record and store data without your consent.	1

8187	So easy. Simply scan and check in without wasting much data	0
8188	Not at all a reliable app. This app says the person with this number is COVID positive even when i have never got my self tested from any ICMR certified lab and i am health Not even a little bit of cold.I was barred for visiting some places just because the app says i am COVID positve	2
8189	Very hard to find the affected areas	1
8190	Using Samsung S9 and finding very big battery drain issues (way more than the phone's reported daily battery use stats) and itnerference with Bluetooth speakers. I'm all for helping to contain the virus, but these issues will prevent a lot of people from downloading the app. I hope developers are tinkering with updates to fix these issues. My wife has a Samsung S10 and finding even worse issues with battery. With many millions of downloads, the app in its current version is bound to cause someone somewhere to have a phone run dead when they need to make an emergency call or something like that.	1
8191	English version works perfectly. App is clear and easy to use.	0

8197	Nice! This is like a fast Corona test	0
8198	Good intentions but the given reason it wants Location Permissions is not true - as far back as June 2019 Google has already told developers you can use the CompanionDeviceManager to perform a (Bluetooth) scan of nearby companion devices on behalf of your app without requiring the location permission.	2

8204	The app keeps closing itself so yeah. Not great.	1
8205	App is always deactivating by itself and nothing tells me it did. And when it's activaed, it asks the permission to run in the background. Why can't it register the permission ? Edit 31/10/20: Since yesterday I had to allow background permission three times!	2
8206	Just downloaded the app with no issues. It activated immediately and all the information and instructions are in English - a brilliant translation. I suspect this is because I still have an English provider, although I can't be sure. It's also Open Source, which is a huge plus for me.	0
8207	It's good application	0
8208	Very funny.. i type my ic number till can't work..	2
8209	Very bad app it requires too many permissions i don't know why..! Plus it askes for ID expired date and without it it won't work....very bad app.	1
8210	Its not working when i enter date of birth " /" is not working.. I can't register.. Please fix this issue asap...	2
8211	App causes connection problems with bluetooth earbuds and headphones. The Bluetooth scanning of the app interferes with the Bluetooth connection.	2
8212	There is no interaction with the app on how it works and why the GPS signal is needed (drains more battery). But you only need to install a GPS emulator app to report a fake location if privacy is your concern.	1
8213	A safe and great idea.	0
8214	Good	0
8215	I have just downloaded it now, but when i tried to open it, it says an error has occured. Please fix this \ud83d\ude4f	1
8216	When I tried to connect it says exceeds validation..there are constant problems with it...and the customer service is extremely unhelpful. How are we supposed to go anywhere without it if it doesn't work? It's no good and very frustrating.	2
8217	This app interfere with Bluetooth ldac audio, i am getting multiple lags everyday listening thru ldac codec while commuting. Need to lower to aptx or lower to maintain connection and latency.	2
8218	New update requires location to be turned on.	2
8219	After installing the app is not opening, not working. Kindly support to fix the issue. Contact centre not answering calls.	0
8220	Would be irresponsible to not have this app. It will help Australia prevent large outbreaks and allow us to live more normally. The reviews about Bluetooth dropping out seem to not be generally true. I use Airpods via Bluetooth with my Samsung S8 and it all works fine.	1
8221	Consume 3.5% of my battery in 1hr. If I am out 12 hr, 42% of my battery is drain. This is a big pain for many users. Pls look into how it can b improve.	1
8222	I think this app is interfering with my POSB app. After installing TT my POSB app keep hanging or blanking out.	2
8223	Most important thing here is that it helps to keep us safe and allow things to start opening up - that's the top priority of this. Some feedback is that it's causing music and casting to stutter on a regular basis - concerned that some people might delete because of this.	0
8224	Very frustrating to download as could not register. Stuck at message "invalid phone number". After much searching found a suggestion to turn on data instead of WiFi, which worked. Needs more guidance on the app or help page	2

8234	Would love to use the app but the Ts&Cs are riddled with errors (even after the most recent update), undefined terms and - buried near the end - a reference to how the developers might "remotely access your device (s)" through undisclosed means. Proof-reading the Ts&Cs is the easiest QA of all, so this doesn't bode well for the actual code; all enough for me to give it a miss for now and promptly uninstall.	0
8235	Easy to set up. The only permission it asks for is location data and it makes sure your bluetooth is on, which is no problem. No data leaves your phone and it's easy to generate that information if you are ever asked to provide it by a health official.	0
8236	Useless app i would give a 0 start for this app i was tested positive 6 months back i am negative for past 5 months i have taken multiple results all are negative but still this app shows positive	1

8245	I upgraded from Stop Covid, and the app stopped crashing. We can clearly see the alert status (I wasn't sure where the alert messages would go with the previous app). A lot of useful info (the counter of app users is funky).	2

8258	Not sure yet, but concept excellent.	0
8259	Very easy to set up - asks for minimal information, just first name and number. Only problem is I nearly uploaded my information at the bottom where it asks \u2018has a health professional asked you to upload your information?\u2019 I think that\u2019s just for confirmed cases???!  Not worried at all about scaremongering of the government having my info - I have a Medicare card, bank accounts, a passport, licence etc - pretty sure I have enough for them to track me if they could be bothered! and if privacy is really a concern to you - why are you people on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, PayPal, eBay, etc etc etc.... they have more than enough on you if they want!   Do it - look after each other Australia - let\u2019s not be like Europe or the USA and lose so many lives.	0

8281	well done for the rapid Safe Entry scanning. Other than that, I'm not interested as to my exposure. Causing unnecessary panic to some users that I know personally. Unless data to me.

8296	While I understand the possible need to scan the QR code the first we are at the location (as opposed to finding it on a list like the Singpass app - Safe Entry), one handy feature that is missing from the Trace Together app that would be good to have is having your favorites show up based on your location rather than showing the full list (reference how Singpass app- Safe Entry handles their favourites)	2

8341	Make it available for android 5 and below. Help the older people to stay save too. Our Oppo phones are only 3.5 years old, but have android 5.1.1. I would have to root the phones to upgrade to 6 or better. Wouldn't take that chance it might brick the phones. These Oppo phones are excellent for everything else. Banking apps, Bluetooth etc.	1

8376	The app launches slowly (takes more than 5 seconds) and uses a lot of background RAM (>1GB) and slows down my phone a lot. While running in the background, it keeps crashing. If you're going to mandate the use of TraceTogether, pls make this app more usable.	2

Previously, even visiting downstairs to the supermarket would show something like 25 exchanges. Today, I went to home team NS adventure centre for my swab test, even after returning my app says 0 exchanges. The app status says it's working fine in the notification box.

Even though the app primarily uses Bluetooth for positioning, what if the app is closed? I advise keeping the app running in the background just in case and adding it to your app whitelist if you have automatic-app-closing activated on your device.	2

8552	After clearing the cache, reinstalled the app several times and going on trying to activate, atlast I got the message 'Exceeded number of activation' please contact 109. Busy, many on the line, will call back in 2 hours, this is the usual reply every time. I don't know what to do now. I need to go hospital and other places. But I don't know how it is possible without this app.	2
8553	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

8570	Few months ago I once tried it for a week or two i.e. on a 2019 Samsung Galaxy phone with huge mAh Battery, I got the impression it worked THOUGH not properly Tested. Recently Got rid of phone due to GPS and BT issues. Was NOW thinking of re-installing it on a 3yo XIAOMI Phone. GLAD I stopped to read Reviews. AMAZED that DEV has NO INTEREST in FEEDBACKS nor giving solutions. That to me equates to NOT caring if App works OR gas given up on it....you be the judge. My mind is NOW 100% made up \ud83d\udd1a	1

8598	Tracker is working now that I've stopped the phone from optimising battery on the app. It's saving keys! The contact tracing only says it's not active when you boot it because it's doing a check that it's running. It is still actually working! Brilliant stuff.

The part where we need to key in the phone number cannot be seen, I can't scroll down not shrink it. I have to to go the phone settings to reduce the size. If people didn't know the work around, they would assume the app can't be used.	0

8654	Stupid app, you need to leave the app to see the pin sent but when you go back in the app starts from the beginning and you are sent a new pin. I was going to use but now deleted. Typical Gov initiative all noise no substance. This has nothing to do with the earlier problem of not being able to register either.	1
8655	All is fake it's all plans of modi g to make people scare	1
8656	I download twice but its show only AL HOSN nothing else	1
8657	I install this app but unfortunately app is not responding anything very bad experience with this application.	2
8658	It's not so informative as expected. Asking all personal details like ID, age, health conditions, even asking if you work in the health sector, but after all what you can see is just the fact you live in a risky place. I knew it before, but thought I would be able to get more details rather than something general. You can't find any further specific data about a particular area, neither the number of cases in your location nor the marks of the buildings with the infected people living there.	1

8730	Great idea however.... Left arm doesn't agree with right arm. Gov and health minister stated on the news it doesn't track your location. Guess what it does. Doesn't like you denying access to your location. Nothing to hide nothing to worry about however when it's lied that it doesn't track location and it does.... sorry man of Principe and be open and honest Mr Morrison. I've removed the app. Due to failure of transparency and your left arm has no idea what the right does with the app.	0

There are known issues with iOS, so it's unlikely that I'm getting contact info from any iPhones. I've always had Bluetooth enabled (watch, car audio) but this app doesn't play with other devices, continuously dropping audio being the easiest example.	1

Again on 21Dec 2020, this app has banged in same like on 17 Sep 2020. I don't understand what is wrong.	2
8805	Good application for avoid the spreading of corona virus and also please update the application for using without QID peoples so many peoples are in visit visa and other visa so update the application for using all qatar peoples	0
8806	In the info about the app, it shows the last update as being in July. Wasn't it updated in Aug?	2
8807	Dear all please check the app seem there is an issue I dont have this app on my mobile and I got like 10 times otp to login which is weird	1
8808	Need URGENT help.I cannot even install the app. It gets stop downloading after it is 99% installed. I tried more than 100 times still can't download it . I have to travel somewhere and need this app to be downloaded immediately.	2

8831	It's so strange why the developers have developed such a simple app that requires ios 13.15 or newer \nAnyone on iPhone 6 or below can not use the app. The government has spend so much money but it would really worth it as more half of the users can not even get it on their phone.	2

8839	App almost unusable anymore. Since one week, the app consumption has gone from 2-3% to around 30% of the battery, leading to an early shutdown of the device which therefore isn't tracing anymore. And if we want to save the battery then we have to stop the app which, of course, stop the tracing either. Early user of this app, I'm really convinced of its value, so it's really sad that developers have made a version which will have a negative impact on the contact tracing overall. EDIT : @Government Technology Agency : I had reached out to your support center before, but as per your comment, I've just sent an email to your services with all detailed infos.	1
8840	Can't even registered. Said that there's error in details. I rather wait for the token to be distributed. Or else don't go anywhere at all.	2
8841	App was rushed out to apease the masses that this Goverment had any idea on how to deal with this virus. APP has not appeated to be useful in this regard. Therefore i will remove it.	1
8842	Drained too much battery, ate over 20% of my battery	1
8843	Saving the world so I can go out and play!	2
8844	my name is zainudin, this app is no good. why? forcing to use bluetooth which will drain the battery. scanning the QR code is much better and easy to use	2

8852	No issues so far. All good.	0
8853	Not the simple easy for everyone to use app it was supposed to be, surely keeping Australia safe doesn't have to be so confusing	1
8854	Total rubbish. A repurposed "find my dog" Bluetooth app. NOT use GPS or location data. Only Bluetooth. It will not track your location. WILL NOT MAKE YOU SAFE.	1

8871	The QR scanning doesn't work for me. I've tried multiple locations and it always says that it isn't a recognised Safe entry QR code. And the feedback/contact us doesn't work either. So hence my review here. Can't be a phone issue. Singpass and the phone's built in scanner works fine.	2
8872	Not sure what the point is when it keeps shutting down	2
8873	Battery hog, sort of 80's experience	1
8874	This does not work.\n For exemple if I am at a restaurant with plastic windows around me it does not take it in consideration. No app can be 2M precise, and even if you are behind a wall they cannot tell. \nWhich means in a majority of cases.\n This will stress people out more than help people out. \nIt’s a good idea, but we don’t have the required ressources to apply it correctly.	1
8875	Hopefully we get a good uptake with this app. Helps the government keep us safe. Not really concerned with privacy etc.	0

8879	This application gives you current coronavirus statistics and the HES code which is mandatory for domestic travel in Turkey. I downloaded it for the latter reason. However, it is not clear how the code works. The application should clarify this. You just get the HES code, and use it for travel.	0
8880	Unable to register, as I can't select DOB feom my phone. Please fix the bug. Thanks	2

8887	this is garbage. there is absolutely no reason to use location for what this thing does. bluetooth is an acceptable privacy breach for the cause, but this is beyond anything reasonable. also, if it's as safe as you claim - publish the sources for what you actually deploy, so we can peer review them. just like us, you have nothing to hide. right?	1

8895	Its GREAT! It makes me feel proud seeing Philippine advances its technology to the next level. As an IT person, I personally like the idea of putting such effort to resolve this pandemic global issue. For me, It somehow gives relief and confidence to people that are being scared or paranoid in their daily trips for it provides contact tracing capability. Although it might sacrifice a bit your mobile's battery, at least you are aware of your circle. KUDOS to Philippine Government & Developers	0

8903	When login using NRIC, it indicated only require name and NRIC number. The date of birth and date of issue not required to key in. But if don't key in these 2 information, system refused to let you proceed. Scam app, give incorrect instruction.	2
8904	It doesn't work for Huawei Mate 30 Pro. It was stuck at the OTP step.	2
8905	Very disappointed to see that this app has been draining my phone battery, as a required app to help keep us safe I am not sure what to do should I delete and reload or leave it off? And what should be done with phone as my battery is not keeping the charge ????????	1

8911	Does its job.	2
8912	It was nice to know there's an useful apps related to Covid -19 specifically when we are at a red zone or in a crowd, our mobile will beep. Then I installed it but at some other time, when I tried to open the apps, it does not work, the apps closed directly. Anyway, I don't know if it''s really useful or not.	2
8913	Doesn't work without permanently enabling GPS and/or Wi-Fi based location, even though the app doesn't use either. Deal breaker for me as I keep location off for privacy reasons unrelated to this app. Apparently due to bad permission design on Google's side?	2
8914	Why can't the apps incorporate safe entry like Sing Pass with QR quote and can checkout without having to scan again so that we don't need to use different apps to do same thing.	2
8915	Why this software in not update	2
8916	Can this app have a way of indicating if and when the 1.5 m gap is breached?	2
8917	Can I register this app on 3 device with same contact number ??	2
8918	I just can't install the app, well I can, then go through the settings and deny access to photos and numbers which should be my right and I allow location and then it keeps coming up with an error page, I've tried several times.	2
8919	Actually i cant use this app because i already download it but it kept crashing and didnt want to open and said thad the app keep stoping and i need to close it, so i decide to uninstall it and install it back. But it do the same it keeps stopping.	2

8939	I found that the app interferes with my other Bluetooth devices. Following installation of the app my phone kept disconnecting from my car and my headphones.

8942	Can't ebable exposure notifications. Do not work!	1
8943	It does not work, otp was typed correctly and did not work properly, so was my personal particulars and I could not proceed.	2
8944	Can't get the OTP... How to install! The developer state the Huawei Mate 30 cause it. But my bank app have been in mate 30 using OTP got not problem. So... If you want this app as only one app. It is no a good app, key reason is Bluetooth is on even you kill off the app when you are at home. It don't make sense at all to on bluetooth when you are at home!. I will go for the QR scanner better. Plus check out the covid active area will do.	2
8945	The app puts a heavy toll on the device's Bluetooth.	2
8946	Excellent	0
8947	Wow	0
8948	There should be means to select the locations similar to singpass as not all would be able to scan the QR code. Case in point, myself with a defective camera in an otherwise perfectly functioning phone.	2
8949	I opened the app and said that I am good no symptoms and left it for a few days and it seems that app was not running since the 4th of August until the 6th when I reopened it, so when I was out on the 5th I could have been in contact with someone (e.g. someone who coughed in KFC). (1. Logs to see when the app last sent data.) (2. New cases in each county per 24 hours) (3. No Storage Permissions required for logging IDs Hi-CPU usage) (4. Weekly notifications something new, needs to be adjusted).	1

8969	Why is this app always on without having to turn LOCATIONS some phones and not others? Both our phones are same make and mine is newer model, yet I have to manually turn Location on even though I gave given it permission to be on all the time. Why is this?	2
8970	In the last few days my battery has been drained by this app . This app is using over 73% of my battery. The phone is over heating as a result.	1
8971	It seems they have fixed the interruptions to Bluetooth and I am happy to use it again. Terrible interruptions to any Bluetooth stream. I can not listen to music without this app stopping the stream for 10 seconds or more. Tried to stop app while using my phone for music but it comes back on. I would have to uninstall and reinstall when interacting with people to tolerate it. Not worth it while SA is covid-19 free. I have uninstalled it until I hear that the Bluetooth is fixed.	0

8991	Well done ScaleFocus!\nThis idea comes in 2007 by the American Doctor Larry Brilliant who suggested to create a website with similar idea of logging symptoms before/during an epidemic in order to isolate the virus spread. I am glad that Bulgarian company recreated this idea in such a short time. Hope they could give the rights to other countries ao they could use it in the prevention of Covid19.\nThe app is simple and easy to navigate. Hope they could add more features soon, as for example the personal statistics tab where you could see the history of logged symptoms. \nKeep up the good work! ??	0

9000	Useless app	1
9001	Why does app needs access to my storage and phone? And no it's nothing to do with security of my device... Why would I give u full access to my fone... It's against every privacy policy... Giving access to location is still somewhat acceptable but why storage?	1

9033	EDIT: Apple has released iOS version 12.5 on older devices that now support the Apple/Google Covid tracking framework. \n\nWHEN WILL THIS APP WORK ON OLDER DEVICES?\n\nI have Bluetooth enabled on my phone. Why can’t you invest a bit more time to make it compatible with more devices?  \n\nBased on the reviews I’m not the only person who can’t use it. There are enough idiots in this country ignoring health department directions who won’t install this app.  Please don’t exclude those of us who want to use it. For the health of me and the strangers around me expand support for this app. Or release a second version for older iOS versions.	2

After the Covid? ????? ?????? , ????? ?????? ??? ????.. ??????? ???? ????? ??? ??.. ?????? ????????? ??? ??? ??	1
9052	Seems to work better on Chinese made devices. Probably because that's were the virus was manufactured. It's doing its job as I have been protected from the virus so far. I wish they made a diarorah app that would also prevent me from getting that as well. So far this app as also been invisibly zapping away the cold virus and other germs. If anyone looks sick it's best to point your phone at them with the app on. This will sterilise them to give you enough time to escape without getting COVID	1

Suggestion: options like SafeEntry/Exit QR-Code Scan, ID BarCode and list of Visited Places is not available for non-locals. Perhaps you may want to add this feature to all users of TraceTogether. Keep up the good work, Team. Stay Healthy and Stay Safe.	0
9063	No feature to add family members for checking in. Unlike version 2.4 in ios. For the fact the you put ios users ahead of andriod users. That's a 2 star from me. Hope if you want to introduce features, make sure you can roll out the updates for all OS at the same time.	2
9064	Why always need update	2
9065	View Nice	0
9066	Sir I can't access.please help me I can't open	2
9067	Wow nice app very effective for contact tracing. Credit to the creator of this app. Thank you that you created this contact tracing app for android and iOS application. We can declare our health condition for the monitoring of LGU and received health tips if you have symptoms.#staysafe	0
9068	You got to fix this app. It's lagging alot that same question mark is showing I tried deleting it 4TIMES but still the same things appear now I can't go anywhere because of this lag please fix this problem	2
9069	Update frequently	1
9070	Unable to register, it is mentioning 'ID card expired', but my ID card is valid. Please resolve this issue at the earliest.	1
9071	This is an awesome app. With the new normal situation, it is better to be safe than sorry. The scanning feature really helps us avoid and be cautious of risky areas. Thank you for this app.	0
9072	Not sure why I have a Brunei country attached for me to enter my phone number for OTP. Not able to change it no matter what I did. And I'm stuck in Toa Payoh while trying to start the app.	2
9073	Great initiative...lets lead the world and defeat this virus! Stay Safe and Stay Happy!	0
9074	Helping my husband (army regular) to download and register the app. App requested for NRIC date of issue for completion of registration. Army guys do not have NRIC with them so it's puzzling why this piece of information is critical for registration. Thumbs down. Update: Yes, of course I read that part. Why make it extra harder for NS servicemen to download and start using this app? If this piece of information is not critical, why request for such information??	2

9084	Hi admin, i am using a redmi phone and it keeps kicking me out of the app, ive already allowed all permissions for the app but still not running well. How may i go about it?	2
9085	I like the idea of the app, but I will have to delete it from my phone. If I start with a 100 % charge in the morning and do nothing else (and I mean that literally) the app will consume all of my battery life. This is in a situation where there has been no one around me to log any contacts. Yes, I am using an older SE with 90% capacity but at least with the Alberta app I was able to enable or disable as needed when I was going to be in contact with others. In the current state this app is unusable for me.	1

9089	Good app	0
9090	Dont even think about using bluetooth devices with your phone when this app is running. I installed the app on Samsung S20. When I am using a bluetooth headset with my S20, while the app is running in the background, I will experience frequent stutters in my headset.	2
9091	Nice app	0

9093	Too many fields to fill in. Why can't we use singpass mobile to login? If the fields are not filled in, we can't even use the app. good idea, but implementation could be better Just tried to sign up again. But it says my IC is invalid??!!	2
9094	Unable to register. OTP didn't work. I input into the app the exact code received via SMS but the app says invalid code	2
9095	Ok	0
9096	Thanks for developing it - considering what kind of private / sensitive information (a multiple of what is disclosed / collected here) each of us agrees to provide to Apple, Google, WhatsApp & co when using their software - I don’t understand why some people are concerned \n\nYep - everyone should install it!	0

9116	What happen to PDPA why do u need our IC details??? And is it a must to give access to our location. I don't want to allow Access to my location. Since it's connect via bluetooth why need location??	2
9117	This app was draining my battery and overloading my phones system. My phone also became exceptionally hot, so hot I thought it might possibly catch fire. I would reinstall it if this problem experienced by thousands of ex-users is resolved. Everything returned to normal as soon as I uninstalled it.	1
9118	Nobody even asks to c it even at airport's.	1
9119	I support the project. But in my case it consumes a lot of battery and my phone do not reach the evening any more. That is also the moment of the day where I potentially meet more peoples. So it makes the application unuseful to me. Maybe an idea would be to have the possibility to define some criteria where the application stop itself. For example by checking for available wireless? I think the application don't need to run at home or at work (if it is not related with public). That would maybe save a lot of battery.	1
9120	I feel safe knowing I have it on	0
9121	Good	0
9122	Just a Tip on saving battery life , pls ON ur Bluetooth only when ur outside/ commuting . U don't need this app to be working when ur home.	1
9123	I say that one think of this app is very important and useful.	0
9124	Installed, and waited for 3 times, for the OTP to be send to me. No OTP was send to my HP number at all. So uninstalled the app again ~	2

9129	Great idea "if" it works and enough people have it but the icon constantly visible is really annoying and continually reminding me about bluetooth when I'm at home 85% of the time anyway.	0
9130	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0

9142	High battery usage. I downloaded it for the intended purpose and would have let it run on my device. Unfortunately, it is draining my phone battery insanely fast, literally making it impossible for me to use the phone.	1
9143	When I keyed in my NRIC, it couldnt register it.i waited for the next day to try again, and the same thing happened. It's rather frustrating	2
9144	This app is a great idea and something that people should use .....but.... For the last few days some aspect of it is causing my battery to drain really fast . This needs to be addressed fast before people are turned off from using the app .	1
9145	Quick, easy setup. Seems to be running in the background with no issues (Pixel 3).	0

9148	Good	0
9149	It says it's inactive because I haven't got location on. I don't normally have location on because it chews my battery but even if i put it on, the app says it's inactive because location is off. Even if I restart the phone. No wonder it's not helping the authorities much. Useless!	2
9150	Good	0
9151	Has really started draining battery, single biggest battery use of any app on my phone. Really needs to be fixed otherwise people won't install it. I can't have my phone dying while I'm out but it won't last 8 hours of even light usage since the last update. Edit update - battery usage seems to be connected with battery optimisation being switched on. I hadn't realised the app no longer worked with battery optimisation on. Battery usage is ok now I've switched optimisation off.	1

9218	Samsung a50 user. Love the app as in, it scans very fast compared to just using hp's camera or qr scanner. Nice to hav my check ins in a list, easier to choose/see which to check out from. But it's cause a lot of disconnection/staggered connection issues with my bluetooth headphone. It's very annoying.. I hope this issue the app cause to other bluetooth devices can be fixed soon. UPDATE: I'd give a Zero star now if i can.. i JUST update the app, and realize it pings ZERO exchanges now! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f	0

9229	Too complicated..if last effort of 5 attempts failed again I would not have registered.

9260	The app seems to be working OK, but with a heavy drain on the battery. The source code has been published once, but is not being updated with subsequent releases. That's simply not good enough! Feedback from the technical community about vulnerabilities and other bugs is being largely ignored. For now I'll be holding off on installing any updates. I will be removing the app soon if the code scrutiny situation doesn't improve.	1

9262	Very good.	0
9263	Is the battery drain issue STILL not fixed? I appreciate that this was caused by a problem introduced by a Google Play Services update, but surely this should already be addressed by now - it's been several days. My wife's phone was affected, and I had to clear data from Google Play Services to fix that, and it's been fine since, but still... This issue has undermined all your efforts, and it needs to be resolved sooner than this.	1

9277	Technical recommendations: Many users, does not read the activation steps, that must be shown as steps by step navigation wizard. Many users does not know that 'enabling bluetooth' is essential for registering first time. Those who get popup messages such as 'ID card expired' or 'error registering' must first enable the bluetooth and try again. Instead of above message, the developer can add the specific reason, so that it will be more user friendly.	2

9283	Why in my application says still under quarantine. My barcode is still yellow. But I'm already finished in my test and it says negative. And I already call for maintenance. Always telling me to wait for update.	1
9284	Suggest the message You're Okay box move to below the common use box Share this app and Safe Entry. Because currently every time check-in you need to scroll down to access the Safe Entry to scan the 2D barcode which is very inconvenient especially moving shop to shop in shopping mall.	2

9295	The app seems to work fine, but there are some UX problems and going from the dev comments there won't be a fix. Here are some of the issues I could cram in 500 words: - The intro should be visual without too much text so less tech savvy people won't be afraid to keep it installed. I have an IT background, but I know a lot of people that don't get it. - Have a language selection IN THE APP. My phone is set up for English, but I want this app to be displayed in Dutch.	2

I leave my home once a week and don't want to have Bluetooth and location enabled the other six days, nor these annoying notifications... Update: Yesterday I got a notification about a potential infection. Very nice as the app seems to work, but I almost missed it because I'm very used to wiping away SwissCovid's notifications...	2
9311	observed strange behaviour from this app in the last few hours. devoured battery life and caused the device to heat up noticeably. i've never seen something like that before - uninstalled the app, believing it had been hacked. strange behaviour that warrants investigation.

9326	It's a shame that this app can't be used with Android 5, so people with older phones (like my parents) can't use it...	1

9338	I agree with turning on bluetooth and giving my phone number. I do NOT agree with enabling Location which the app says is compulsory for it to work. This is being misrepresented. If it is only using bluetooth to trace contact with others then Location is not necessary. Enabling Location tells Google where i am which i refuse. This app is probably just part of Five Eyes and other anti-human anti-freedom programs. I cannot recommend this for humans.	1
9339	Very good app ðŸ‘Œ	0

9356	Unable to sign in after change new phone recently. Keep spinning after fill up doc id. Any customer contact can escalate my issue?	2
9357	It's the best application that I saw ever. The motive of the app is excellent. It will alert us if we are suspected or not as we will pass by or contact by a covid effected person. So by that we can go for self quarantine or go for a medical checkup. It will help us and will protect others also. The only issue by this app is the drain of the battery. It's is consuming toomuch battery charge. Just only try to fix it.	0

9392	The app forces you to always keep your location turned on, and you should allow it to access media, to manage and make calls, and once you access the app, it askes to turn on the Bluetooth, Just what kind of an IT did this app? Who allows to have their personal space taken away? Based on what I MUST allow it so it works? Assume I don't want to allow it to access my phone personal photos and pictures, then this app will go sad and crying in a corner because I deny its access? And will not work!	1

9448	Easy download and I can always delete it.	0
9449	What are batteries? You might think this is rhetorical of sort but it's actually the question u ask when having this app on your phone. Also, it seems that privacy is at an all time low as it asks for every function on your phone. 10/10 would download again if needed.	1
9450	bad	1
9451	Ineffective. It takes only a few seconds to become infected, but this app takes minutes before it register a contact. The idea is good but, the implementation is not a functional tracker.	1

9476	Doesn't work with default settings. You have to change power usage settings. I am pretty sure, that most of the users don't do that and therefor the app is useless.	1

9512	Lousy app. Keep crashing other apps..	2
9513	Gave 1 star due to horrible tone deaf ad on tik tok and its feeble attempt to reach anyone. Its Like a bung of 60 year old marketing execs watched a rerun of saved by the bell and they had the students watching a safety video that was trying to be cool and they took that premise to get younger people to download the app.	1
9514	If there is information about the current restriction it will be better.	2

9537	Wrecked my battery and ended up buying a new phone as a result...	1
9538	Please add a QR Scan Widget if you are to make this app mandatory. Additionally, since it's not possible to physically be at 2 places at the same time, why doesn't a new "check in" (in a new place) automatically check you from the previous place?	2
9539	App keeps crashing when keying in date of issue?	2
9540	Why this app need permission of photos nd media?????	1
9541	Does it work for Americans	2
9542	(previously a 5 star review - now changed to 1 star) The app says it's working, but in the notification bar is says "COVIDSafe is not active" - and no matter what settings, permissions or restarting - it won't change. No longer sure if it's keeping me safe from COVID-19 !	1

9557	The application doesn't work! Ever since I arrived today at 7 am, I instantly installed and activated the application, I keep getting notifications that I should check in, however, when I go to heck in, I'm faced with this statement "No check in is required currently" additional the tracking doesn't seem to work even though I gave the application full access to my location all the time. This is rather disappointing and worrying as I keep getting these warning and I can't do anything about it.	2
9558	I tested on 30.4.2020, result showing not tested, when i called customer care, they told it will only show results of drive through test.	2
9559	It is good because it helps me be covid-19 safe so this is why I think that this game is the greatest game	0

9572	It work for two days and then it stops by itself. Impossible to open again.	2
9573	Always screws around with my buds. I have to always force stop this app just to get my buds to re connect	1

9575	I am facing a problem with music applications, audio will pause automatically, after uninstalling this app i am not getting the error. Please help..	2
9576	Useless!!! Unless the time spent near other users before it logs contact is reduced substantially this app is nothing more than a personal data collector for the government.	1
9577	What many says is true. It drained out the battery like a vampire. It is suprise to see that it won't show in the battery usage. Battery usage in Android will not show this app consumed so much battery. Not sure how the developer bypass/manage to do this. What is even more surprise me is that developer did not address/bother to reply on this issue. Hahaa...	1
9578	Don't like the notification status bar stayin on top all the times, it's annoying. But don't mind the app running in background.	1

9619	Cant use bluetooth to listen to music without interruption. High consumption of battery. Had to uninstall the app. Please improve the app design.	2

9624	I have gotten three alerts. They come every 14 days. The public health people say it gets caught in a loop and keeps goving you false alerts. The other thing they say (and web search of reputable medical journals and popular press articles supports) is that the Bluetooth signal strength is an insufficient measure of distance to assert six feet. Getting an alert can only reasonably be said to mean you were within 20 meters (60 feet) of someone who signaled a positive. Not six feet. Search and read to decide yourself.	1

9637	Draining battery and overheating the phone like crazy! Was using pretty much since the app was released, but uninstalled it now. Unless the issue is fixed, will not reinstall. Still believe it's a great concept and it's a shame had to uninstall it.	1

9650	Install the apps, but keep showing connection error. Even restart the phone, also the same.	2
9651	Agree with other users. The app should give a daily/weekly summary advising that you have or haven't been in contact with another user who has tested positive. Just like the ios version does. Other than that, fine.	2
9652	Works perfectly and only a small app. If you are unsure about it- think of the health workers that you might just save by downloading this...	0
9653	Good	0
9654	lil slow	1
9655	Destroys bluetooth usability. Causes frequent cut outs and drops of Bluetooth when near another device with the app running. I didn't want to remove it, but the safety hazard from it interfering with my hands free meant it had to go.	1
9656	Essential app these days	0
9657	Very bad	1

9725	I can't believe people are whining about the notification being on all the time, the possibility of their battery being drained, about having to turn Bluetooth on and off etc. This app might help to save lives, including your own... that's a pretty fair trade for the minor inconvenience...	1
9726	Too confusing	1
9727	Battery killer. Was working fine, up until yesterday, with no affect on battery. Now it is destroying my battery, using it all up in a few hours. Tried uninstalling & reinstalling, but hasn't fixed it. App is unusable until this is fixed. Which, considering the point of the app, is sub optimal, to say the least.	1

9760	It's written it needs Bluetooth ON all the time, Ok for that, it's the way it works. But it also requests GPS autorisation to be ON all the time, leaving other apps to potentially drain battery! Disappointed that the government together with our polytechnic schools weren't able to make something clean. Only reason to accept it is for protecting society.	1
9761	Best example of how to waste public money. How many contact traces done with this? App needed location access all time. But main purpose is to identify anybody come closer to 1.5m distance.. No logic at all. Battery drains rapidly, So need to charge phone one more time during the day. So many updates since first release, but no evidence of this app is working. Only good thing is keeping few people in job who built this app and staff working for the companies who ran 60+million campaign.	1
9762	Americans are incredibly dumb and this app proves why. Seriously, you all are complaining because the app drains your battery? God forbid you have to get up and go get your charger, right? Be thankful you have the technology to detect cases around you. You people are stupid.	1
9763	It says temporarily unavailable, try again later and it has been like that for 2 days already!!! When is it going to be fixed? I cannot check in to stores using phone and I have not collected the tracetogether token as it's not available in my region yet! And we also cannot help others to check in!!! So how?	2

9776	Worst app ever, battery drain and constantly on. Should only turn on when you choose. Has constant alert when blue tooth is turned off. Needs to be more user friendly	1
9777	The Worse APP ever, this app keeps always the Bluetooth on, and drained my battery verry fast, I just install when I have to go out, some times it's showed up a OTP error, but now it says that I had exceeded the the number of activation. Now the app says that I have to call 109, I called and I waited about more than 20 minutes and nobody answered me.	1

9809	The initiative of the app was to ensure safety & to protect human beings itself from COVID virus however, the app itself seems to prone to it & infected by Trojan spyware as diagnosed by antivirus softwares. Since, the government has taken a wonderful initiative with a beautiful concept to make people aware about contaminated zones & to avoid physical contacts to ensure safety. So, would request govt to take appropriate action to make it malware free so that we can use it without any concerns.	0

If they are Covid positive, presumably in quarantine, how could I be exposed to the virus because of them?\nC.  How stupid would they have to be to report their condition to the app and then go out to expose others who may have the app??!!	1

9827	Want to use this app. Won't accept a valid phone number.	1
9828	This app causes MAJOR connectivity issues between my device and Bluetooth audio devices, such as headphones or speakers. I have seen and spoken to many other people reporting a similar issue; I have attempted to contact support on 3 separate occasions but have yet to receive any response, and the latest major update seemed to not address this fix - infact, it appeared to make it worse! This is a major software issue, especially if you are trying to encourage widespread use of this app.	1
9829	This app keeps turning off because of low battery on my phone. I don't know how to resolve this.	1
9830	A good app, when I go to scan the QR code’s it dose recognise them witch is a slight disappointment and defeats the purpose of it.	0
9831	After upgrading my iPhone to the iOS 14, the exposure notification feature does not work anymore. I have reinstalled the App multiple times, but I get the same results. My wife is also having this exact problem. This is clearly because the Developers have not updated the App to be compatible with iOS 14, even though Apple have made the OS available for Developers for months at this point. Much to be desired from an App that was supposed to track COVID-19...	2
9832	Great app. But why must it constantly be displayed in my notifications? Please do not make it display in my notifications constantly.	2
9833	my app can't connect another device. it's no working.my bluetooth not exchange.	2
9834	After recent update it is not opening	2
9835	Please balance me. I just received a notification to say I’ve been near someone who is positive ON THE 7th of NOVEMBER!!! ARE YOU MAD!!! That’s almost 2 weeks ago!! I’ve been going about my life and this thing is just now telling me that I might have been infected 2 weeks ago?? What’s the use of this app if it doesn’t tell you immediately??!!	2

9859	Seriously, there is no better way to generate data. As well as informing everyone where the Dreaded Rona IS, this app also makes it known how FEW cases there are relative to downloads, and where covid is NOT. This is the best way to prove that the panic is much bigger than the crisis.	1

9889	No words to write brilliant ??????	0
9890	App at background keep turning off	2
9891	Hope it does it's job	2
9892	Can you please add, last updated time and date.	2
9893	Still draining battery even though a fix was supposed to have happened. Have reinstalled, cleared cache...all the stuff that people were advising and I still find it draining. Unfortunately have had to uninstall it again	1
9894	Good	0
9895	Thanks Bahrain and thanks for every one.	0
9896	Amazing.	0
9897	Keeps asking for battery optimisation permission everytime	1
9898	Not working	2
9899	The App as such seems great,gives good information about Covid stats but the assessment questionnaire needs further improvement.The questionnaire needs to be more interactive and intuitive for better understanding of patient health status.Also , the see your recent contacts feature (bit annoying) doesn't really give the user any real information besides the fact that there might be n number of recent contacts that may or may not be at risk. There is no info about which contact it might be.	1
9900	This is the kind of app that you wish doesn't say anything. That said, the app works fine and all, but it should also help improve a user's peace of mind by allowing the user to test exposure with other consenting users. And it's in English and the Japanese authoruties do take their time to ensure that the exposure system is followed through. This makes it even better than some ancient methods like GPS & check-in.	0
9901	Can’t register. Application failed for my FIN number .	2
9902	It worked for about 2 weeks and today it came up not active. Restarted my phone so now I am unistalling it and will try again...	1
9903	I cannot get OTP, it keeps telling me network not available. I used on both wifi and data but nothing worked.	2
9904	Nice	0
9905	Simple and easy to use - just need to turn on the phone's Bluetooth whenever you really need to head out of the house. Thanks for developing this!	0
9906	Excellent	0
9907	Uses a lot of battery on Samsung S7, not even a full day. Requires GPS to be active. I don't use the GPS unless navigating, shouldn't be required as GPS doesn't work inside in any case, and is only supposed to use bluetooth and no tracking. I've uninstalled it, battery now lasts 2 days Also not properly open sourced which is disappointing. Could be so much better, also appears to be limited version control.	1
9908	Excellent	0
9909	I don't like how it keeps tracking location in the background. Wish if they added a way to report violations.	1
9910	Good	0
9911	Easy to use. Then again, nothing much happened yet.	0
9912	It won't accept my phone number, with or without the leading zero, Also why has it the +61 option at start. Therfore only targeting Australian numbers, and doesn't work anyway. Thankyou Australian Government for giving me faith in your software delivery NOT. Deleted now.. also now very wary of downloading anything from these 'backyard operators'	2
9913	Gooe	0
9914	Horrible translations from government as always, in language settings I discovered that Ukrainian is now the official language of United Kingdom. How does one actually overlook such a BASIC mistake?	2
9915	It's real and gives clear updates	0
9916	Easy download and registration. Safer than Facebook.	0
9917	Seems to be causing interference to my wireless earbuds (jabra)	2
9918	Good	0
9919	Well The applications concept seems good But making it that you should report the case urself is wrong Like think of it Who in the world will say I have corona onto an app That is legit trusted by the government	2
9920	Battery drain and security risk (Bluetooth should always be disabled in public areas). Privacy issue as well as there is no guarantee on future leaks of whatever user data collected	1
9921	Good	0
9922	Despite whether this app is actually working, it closed down itself every 30 mins even I have my Bluetooth always on and enabled all permissions it asked. is it just me or anyone else may have this issue?	1
9923	On point	0
9924	After download it is not working so delete it	2
9925	Very straight forward app you download fill steps put your Id No. and phone no. You got otp and finish ,you can see the test result after pressing the Id number	0
9926	Yoir app has somehow disabled all my Google applications including the internet- can't load gmail content or search on internet or open any internet based things from facebook - not happy - this app was the only thing different to normal	2
9927	Very bad app. We got used of draining our batteries and now updating has also become a war. If there is no bad intentions behind this app , please upgrade on it.. app is a total mess	1
9928	Very useful	0
9929	Thanks this, app, good for Health	0
9930	Very difficult to register ..i tried so many times..but not possible ..always i got msg as "something went wrong "	1

9961	It is a very useful app and was very easy to set it up! Thank you for all concerned in creating It! We are in this together	0
9962	Happy with the app. No high power consumption problem.	0
9963	Downloading and using this app is a civic responsibility. Contrary to views expressed by conspiracy nuts and the fake news media, this is a good app, and it strikes a good balance between privacy and the need for public health officials to get data. It now incorporates a Linux Foundation sponsored open source project, which makes it even better, and the contact tracing more reliable. Apple and Google want to cut the government and public health officials out of pandemic response, which is dumb.	0
9964	good app	0
9965	Not allowed to register	2

9971	This app is very useful app	0
9972	I cannot download it. Any update happening in app? \ud83d\ude14	1
9973	Beware of app draining battery constantly getting notifications to turn my Bluetooth on is so annoying please make the app less intrusive and also who would want a app that sends your battery life from 100% down to 5% in less than 2 hours and that's caused by COVIDsafe notifications and Bluetooth being on 24/7 so bloody annoying	1
9974	Grate app but its lacking how many people have recovered from the virus. That's why I gave 3 stars	0
9975	Drastic worst exprnce	1
9976	Am already done test . SMS got negative but this application not showing anything .	1
9977	For android systems, covid-19 notifications could not be activated because bluetooth multiple advertisement is not supported. It says Nearby.EXPOSURE_NOTIFICATION_API is not available on this device. Any fix? Thank you.	2
9978	Why its showing question mark instead of QR code? Before it was working well. Since 2 days its not working properly	2

9996	Followed advice & deleted 2 older apps to free up storage. Tried again. It is still in a "Pending" status. All my other apps work, the only one trying to update is NHS. It's NHS update Got a recommendation to upgrade the app but all you see is the "washing machine" going round, and round, and round..... still in a pending state and you cannot go back and use the previous version. Wanted to check a medical appointment but now can't. Does not look like this upgrade release has been fully tested!!	2
9997	It downloaded perfectly and I was able to register. Remember to perhaps not include the first zero in your mobile number when you register. If you tried earlier today, it may not have worked as they did say from 6pm.	0
9998	Showing question mark, I reinstalled it, and the same issue, I have problem to go in to the mall I work, I called hotline too many times, no answer and never called back	2
9999	I'd be great if you used Google's Exposure Notification API	0
10000	Says wrong credentials and ask to login with some other number which is not mine,i am waiting for two days, need to join my new company in abu dhabi and police is not allowing me to cross the border. Very bad experience.	1

10002	Just yesterday i make a test and i didn't get any result and i ask to the people who make a test for me they said it will show in app but when i open app now they said you tried on wrong number try again now i dont know what to do ..	1

10004	Great idea. Wanted badly to support it, but it has stopped me from answering my phone when it rings. I can't swipe my screen to answer calls so I have had to uninstall. Sony xz2	0
10005	Nice	0
10006	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0

10017	Not able to use the app. The moment I reach the agree terms n conditions page..the app stops. Have uninstalled n installed..but the same result	1
10018	Random disruption to my phone's bluetooth transmission to my wireless earbuds and car's audio. My heavy rock bands sound like they drank too much alcohol and are having hiccups while the divas sound like they are intermittently choking on a toad in their throats. Kindly fix the issue.	2
10019	Hi Admin, I am using Huawei P40 pro handphone. In the process of downloading trace together app, after I insert my handphone number to get my OTP, it stop responding. I have email your admin to assist with this problem but did not receive any reply though I send in 3 to 4 emails for assistance. Please advice how to resolve it. Regards Jason Hi Admin, I have installed Google playstore in my phone. The trace together app is download from google playstore.	2
10020	Very nice App	0
10021	Tha app is not responding	2
10022	idea is good but execution is awfull. Notification doesn't work and the app doesn't tell you when you were in close contact with an infected person, so you have no idea whether the test you may have done is before or after the incident. For all you know it could have been weeks ago. Apparently the 1 meter radius doesn't work either.	2
10023	This app drains so much charging and it dont even work always shows error! If it was not important to have this app for market etc i would have uninstalled it immediately!	1
10024	Apparently my phone number is invalid... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude44	2
10025	I'm currently using Huawei P40 Pro which does not support Google mobile services. The app isn't available in the Huawei App gallery. So, I downloaded the apk file and installed it but it doesn't work and always gets stuck at the OTP. Please find a way to fix it. P40, P40 pro/pro +, Mate 30, Mate 30 pro and a number of other devices do not support Google services and hence unable to use TraceTogether. We can't just buy a new phone just for the sake of using this app. Kindly look into this.	2

10034	It's not working after last update.	2
10035	Unable to register mobile number. Did not get any OTP message despite clicking on GET OTP numerous times. Very disappointing.	2
10036	The app closes by itself even when I am on bluetooth. Ideally, the app should turn on the moment bluetooth comes on and it shouldn't act like an app but rather in the background. I have to use the app and it gets annoying to deal with the constant turn off.	2
10037	This app will tell us all the direction of awareness activities about Corona 19 virus	0
10038	I can't go into the app it's says temporary unavailable but I keep trying also cannot I key in my personal info already	2
10039	Less improvement	1
10040	I cannot even use the app always says sorry temporary unavailable I check all my details it's correct but always display the same thing.. Please check.. Hi I already emailed.. Just waiting for it..	2
10041	It will auto-off and requires permission time and again.	2
10042	I'm not able to register my Fin number, tried many times still not valid number, very weird	2
10043	easy to connect and view..	0
10044	Worst app ever made. It looks like it came from 2005 and works like it came from 1905. Every time i try to enter\nIt.. it requires a verification over and over again. Banking apps require verification 1000 times less than this parody of an app here...	2
10045	Why does the App need to collect birth date and date of identification card ... this is unnecessary information. You already have activation code via SMS, and already asked for full name and identification number, the other 2 pieces of information is unnecessary (something a bank might ask). It's an open invitation to be hacked ...	2

10093	How do you even log in? When you first open the app it asked you for your name and age range followed by sending you a PIN to your SMS. When you go to your SMS to get the pin and go back into CovidSafe app the pin no longer works because you start from the beginning again which is an endless cycle. How does anyone even log into this?	2

10107	Actually I have downloaded this apps before. But when I was listening to my music thru the earphone, the music keep having pauses and this really irritates me. At first I thought only I am facing this issue. Then my wife says she is having the same problem. If an apps is disturbing my daily life and entertainment, I don't see the point of using it. So I tried removing the apps and it went back to normal.	1
10108	Would be great if this app actually downloaded.	0
10109	I always thought of technology as something to be scared of. This app changed my view in so many ways. With this I can protect my fellow earth dweller as well as myself form a life threatening virus. I deeply admire the makers of this amazing app! Thank you thank you thank you	0

10125	Battery needs much charging Burned my finger plugging out charger	1
10126	Useless. Does nothing. Only popular because it's necessitated by governmental regulations.	1

10175	I was happy to install and with functionality however this drained my battery, about 10% every 90mins, just sitting in my bag. Had to uninstall for this reason.	1
10176	Good	0
10177	Not working at all.	2
10178	Each time I go out into public my phone gets disabled by a Bluetooth share failure meaning the app isn't protecting and is forcing me to shut down my phone.	1
10179	Thank you for the outstanding customer service, called 109 twice and was well briefed with how to go about with the App activation. \ud83d\ude4f Stay safe, healthy & positive \ud83c\udf3b	0
10180	I just can't install the app, well I can, then go through the settings and deny access to photos and numbers which should be my right, I allow location and then it keeps coming up with an error page, I've tried several times..I have an android phone.	2
10181	Getting Crashed. The app is getting crashed when trying to open .. Its not opening and when trying to register again its giving error..Need a fix right away..pathetic app ..and we have to show it to the office security for entering the premises..fix it	2
10182	I don't have Indian number and it doesn't have options for different country's code. I am travelling next week to delhi, kindly suggest how I can register myself.	2

10191	Very cool, facilitates your life with a pandemic. Thank you	0
10192	Unable to update home location it show message you can only update within your district! Please fix	2
10193	Good	0
10194	If you're having the issue of it saying your number is invalid, try the following: turn off Wi-Fi (this worked for me), or reset the app (worked for my friend).	2
10195	Easy to install	0
10196	It continues to tell me my phone number is invalid.leading zero or not. Samsung galaxy s9 at latest software level. My wife had no problem with her s10 which is not at latest sw level	2
10197	Not bad	1
10198	This system needs work and is outright dangerous now: * I did a first test (using an app code), tested negative; * had to do a second test, deleted the result, gave the new code; some time after I receive a "tested negative" result; 2 DAYS LATER I receive a phone call from my GP stating I'm in fact very positive. This is super dangerous! Either make a history of tests or fix the mislinking! Maybe state the date of when you generated the code/took the test, rather than the date of when the app last polled the results! * My housemate was positive, but the doc forgot to link the code to the test; so no-one who came into contact with him had results (I didn't get it, and I spend every day, all day with him). We tried calling the contact tracing line, but "there are no developers working during the weekend", not even 1! This should be a basic thing any contact tracer can fix. * Make a "bug report" feature?	2
10199	Nice	0
10200	Does the job The app works well and is really easy to navigate. No issues so far. The possible improvement I see is to create a section where to easily access a list of usual symptoms. Other than that, all good.	0

10207	Worst application as expected they didn't think this app through doesn't login and the technical support number don't take any calls	2
10208	Could use a troubleshooting section. If you are having issues with the contract tracer like I was these are the steps I took to fix it. You need to find the Google Play Services app in your settings. Give it all the permissions and clear its cache. Restart your phone. Sign your life and those of your descendents over to google. Update the Google Play Services app. Start the Covid Tracker app. Select the contact tracer. Give it the final permission it asks for and done.	1
10209	It take high charge..	2
10210	Need to report problem: any time I open the app it says 'tracing is not active so this app will not work' before switching to active once opened. The app says I can close it and it will remain active but this doesn't seem to be the case (as evident when I close and re-open it). I hope this is picked up as I couldn't see anywhere to report issues	2
10211	Well done. Simple to use. Hopefully will help in contact tracing. Anyone not using this is missing the whole point of the app.	0

10216	Updated today but unsure if notifications sound comes on because I've just turned it on or because I have been exposed to the SARS COV 2! Also, I was not notified of recent update!	1
10217	Following the latest update the app constantly stops working and requires me to re-open it. It interferes with my phones bluetooth connectivity to all other devices - car, smart watch etc. Very buggy. Operating on a Samsung s9+	1
10218	Aarogye Setu app is very nice app for protection against covid-19 but few risk in this some people getting high risk notification and after it his contact other's person and take screenshots of "your safe" why are you allow the screenshot please improve this fault soon this is very risky factor for us...	0
10219	Everyone in Australia should get the app, let's protect each other..., however weeks later I have had to down rate as it just doesn't stay on. I have tried locking the app on my Oppo phone and changing battery permission, but the next time I look it has been disabled automatically because of the 'high power consumption' Not good enough unfortunately.	1
10220	Makes your phone vulnerable by exposing its Bluetooth MAC address. Tried decompiling the old app (StopCovid) and found what seems to be plain text server credentials on an XML file. Security needs to be reworked.	1
10221	Good	0
10222	A great app to keep on top of whats happening with covid.i use it every morning but by the afternoon my battery is dead.i have a Samsung 10plus edge and don't use my phone that much.i love the app but want to uninstall for this reason.	1
10223	Useless app, my android phone is only 2 years old but still as soon as screen goes off the app deactivates and shuts down. Fix asap or will uninstall it's not working anyway. Typical government can't get a bloody app right that works for everyone. And they want you to download app, what a joke!!!!!	1

10230	Had the same battery issue but Clearing Storage in Google Play Services, rebooting the phone and the enabling Contact Tracing in the Covid19 app solves the problem. You will also have to enable Phone Backup again (if used) as this will have been disabled by clearing storage in Google Play Services. Hope this helps. Battery drain for a few days is better than lockdown for weeks.	1

10244	Beware. Disgustingly bad battery hog.\n\nUPDATE\n\nIn response to my prior comment Health Canada says ...”the app is designed to\nminimize battery ... usage”.  Really? Seriously?  That’s a flat out lie: If it had been optimized it would have geofenced to stop pinging when at home and it definitely doesn’t, per usage below.  \n\nSingle largest complaint from users is battery drain. Don’t tell me it’s optimized when it patently is not.\n\nUPDATE 2\n\nApp uninstalled from wife’s iPhone SE due to excessive battery drain. \n\n———\n\nIn two days on an iPhone X, 96% of the 32% drop in battery charge was due to this app. It left home for an hour and neither it nor I met anyone. \n\nWorse still was my wife’s brand new iPhone SE: a 26% drop in battery charge was 99% due to the COVID Alert app in 23hrs.  Usually 6-8% drop per day with similar use: the phone hadn’t left her dresser. \n\nGood thing the dog doesn’t have a phone.\n\nClearly some work needed.	1
10245	The day I install this I start getting telemarketing companies calling me... This IS UNACCEPTABLE...update.. Thank you for telling me that it not related, however it is more than a coincidence.	1
10246	Good	0
10247	Good app to start with!\n\nHowever, suggest to use GPS from the service provider, instead of opening the app and running it in the background — May want to refer to Pokémon go (adventure tracing) where it can tracks location and distance whole the app is closed.\n\nWaste of battery and heats up the phone.\n\nThe application runs too slowly or crashes on older iPhone models.\n\nAnother suggestion is to only turn on the app when the user is in a crowded place, meeting, dining, where one lingers more than 30min.	0
10248	Good	0
10249	I have noticed a significant increase in battery usage ever since I downloaded the app. Now I may have to charge my phone multiple times a day instead of just once.	1
10250	I would say that, this app is an excellent service for everyone and we can count-on it.\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcaf	0
10251	I installed the app to do my part in trace mapping but it is sucking my battery dry and I'm considering uninstalling it again just so my phone lasts through the day without recharging twice. Absurd. When I'm home (which is 95% of the time), and I turn off bluetooth, the app should completely shut down. Give me the control to turn it on and off when I need rather than using all my battery even when it's apparently off (which of course it certainly is not). This should be a simple fix. Please do this ASAP! It's turning people off and defeating the whole purpose of it's existence.	1
10252	Can't verify details properly after i switched phone. When i received the otp and keyed it in, it keeps telling me otp is wrong, even after the recent end oct update. Govtech it's not like i don't wanna use it, you guys ain't making it work proper. This is as detailed as i can share.	2
10253	Invalid phone number?? Every time I try and get the pin to activate it tells me my mobile number isn't valid??	2
10254	When I key my nric and proceed next, it's keep prompt me failed. A few times already, how come?	2

10259	Pros : 1. One stop management without having to move between apps like camera and Google chrome to check in/out Cons : 1. Drains battery of mobile phone alot faster before installation. 2. Affects stability of bluetooth connections between mobile phone and other devices such as wireless earphones. Connections either hanged or dropped intermittently	1
10260	I am a android developer certifying this a great work. Using this should be mandatory.	0
10261	When registering using Visa number it further goes registration process after which it says " error requesting OTP.try again ". But even after deleting the app and did a fresh installation it is same. Hopes the technical team will soon elaborate this bug.	2

10263	Terrible rushed job by the Australian Government. You need to use the API's that Google and Apple Co worked on for this purpose globally on their operating system. Stop being a stick in the mud and use the API's, even the German Gov is using the Google & iOS API's. Until you get off your high horse and start using the API's designed by the manufacturer for this sole purpose no one in their right mind will use this abomination of an application.	1

I saw there’s an update but decide not to do that till I’ve got a minute to find my note with the password as I know I’ll need to after updating. But it logged me out even though I didn’t run the update yet. I know I shouldn’t have passwords written down but I simply can’t remember them all and haven’t had time to investigate password apps! Can you stop the app from logging people out - I know it’s happened to others at times too?	2

10335	Every time I scanned QR code in many locations (shopping malls & shops), it won't work properly or recognized the QR code maybe due to too many users at one go. Then due to it must use Bluetooth function, battery consumption is very very high. Why can't it be using normal Wifi that Safe Entry is using.... And is so frustrating to keep scanning QR Code & it can't read...Sigh!	2
10336	The application doesn't allow to enter date of birth either Hijri or Georgian. Kindly fix this problem as early as possible.	2
10337	Downloaded this app after a customer contacted my work to say they had been in contact with someone who had tested positive and had been speaking to a fellow staff member. I thought it would be a good idea to get this... However my first overview of the scans it has done seems that it's a bit pointless. It scans very last at night/early hours of the morning of course I haven't been in contact with someone at that time I'm in bed I wanted it to protect me from customers in my daily work!	2

10409	Not sure that it works, I was at Wijnegem shopping centre the other day (a Saturday) and it was packed with people. I would be very surprised if no-one there raised an alert on my phone. I guess more people need to download & use it? But even then...	2

10420	Very easy to register. Only supplied name, age group, postcode and mobile number. Nothing whatsoever to worry about. Can be uninstalled at any time. I recommend for your own safety, download and register.	0
10421	All working well. Set up simple, fast, registered in under 60 seconds \ud83d\udc4d	0

10431	Is there any way to implement an idea of showing a map with the unfortunately infected residents? Let's say in Prague 4 has a red circle/Hotspot with the number of infected people found. Because now the app purpose is reactive rather than proactive I think	1
10432	Since sorting out battery issues back to be a really great app!!!	0
10433	What the heck...it's really useless... Because of this app we can't enter any place.....first of all its not showing the health status???	1
10434	Some device is not compatible wirh the version, hence cannot download	2
10435	A great app. Registered with ease and well this is going to be for the future of Australia.	0
10436	The app is good but the battery drain especially over the past two days has been ridiculous. Also, my phone was heating up excessively. I was afraid to leave it charging unattended but it was losing battery power so fast that not even using on the charger made a difference. I had to uninstall because I thought my phone was going to go Samsung and burst into flames. Since uninstalling it it's charging faster and my phone has cooled down.	1
10437	Keeps prompting me to check my internet connection, when I try to update my personal particulars- i can assure you my phone internet connection is working just fine!- pls advise on what I can do to resolve this issue, thank you!	2
10438	I have recently changed mobile and app is not gathering new contacts detail. Bluetooth is on and app has all permissions. New mobile models is samsung m31s android10	2
10439	App has added many useful and convenient features. Keep up the good work! It would be good if this app can add the feature to generate a QR code for user ID no. just like the one on the TraceTogether Tag so that it can be scanned by older scanner.	0

10444	My phone used to need charging every 2 to 3 days as its a work phone. Now from 100% to 20% batt only half a day. Seriously? The new version of adding feature to inform user availability of a new version? Honestly it's a waste of time and resources isn't it? U load it up and google play store will inform all users there's a new update.... why do the double job?	1
10445	Its a good app but the check in and check out button are too close to each other, so I may accidentally check out when I want to check in to a certain place. Please keep them further apart!	0
10446	Good	0
10447	So good	0
10448	nice apps	0
10449	Similar problems experienced by most Users here. My Bluetooth earphones would "Blip" (sound disappears then reconnects) at least twice for each song which can get annoying. Drains battery life (using an S9+) like a glutton. Please fix!! P.S. Will be resorting to using the Token instead because of the abovementioned issues soon.	2

10454	I am happy to download the app if it helps keep the virus in check and allows the government to relax restrictions.	0
10455	Irresponsible that qr code check-in has not been implemented. Australians are losing their private data to third parties. The government needs to step up, and protect the privacy of Australians, and provide a safer means to qr code check-in.	2
10456	I'm trying to download but not downloading. How do we download?	2
10457	Good app but is destroying my battery life. Battery down to 63% after only 2 hours of being unplugged with full battery.	1
10458	Checks keep stopping. Useless app	1
10459	Excellent	0
10460	Why this app wants to access my photos and media and phone? I am accepting the location only. Its not working unless i will accept everything and this is not logic for me. So i will not use it unless it will be respecting my privacy. Thank u	1

10485	Great app! The more having this app, the better tracing result we can get. Let help Singapore to fight this COVID-19 together. Good job GovTech \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcaa. With the new exchange feature, will be better if add on a warning notification when come too close to each other.	0

10505	Not sure why the app always stop work and not appear in my notification. Have to keep restart the app.	2
10506	Update 10 Jun '20: Updated the app and experiencing no crashes so far. Posted 07 Jun '20: I re-installed the app to access the option to register with Visa, but the app won't open. I get a system error message saying 'Ehteraz keeps stopping'. I've sent feedback on the issue. Please fix asap.	0
10507	My phone consistently lost all battery in a few hours. Reluctantly uninstalled app on 9/8/2020. Excellent idea for the app, useless if all phones are dead. Let the public know when Google play services have decided to correct the errors please. On a side note, my mobile now is not receiving any calls. All going straight to message. Strange.	1
10508	The app is great for monitoring your self.	0
10509	I believe you need better developers team to create this app on a better way , I’m really sad to see this level	2
10510	Waste of time & effort. It would be easier asking me to ride a camel whilst doing a handstand than perform the tricks needed to confirm ID. Despite it saying opening camera/camcorder, it opens files. If you record the video to then upload, the app restarts and selects 4 new numbers and so it starts again and again and again	1

10533	Your apps is not working? Cant giv 0 star? Why is need to turn on bluetooth that will flat off our battery. After turn on bluetooth it still show "your apps is not working" even multiple exit has been performed. Wasted time. Its the worst QR apps that i have used. Already un-istalled it. Will use IC for entry tracker for some placed that insist of using Tracetogether apps.	2
10534	Block off/Disabled all my other bluetooth devices	2
10535	Tried it before and it never accepted my information, this time I tried it again after the announcement that u need an HES code to get into government buildings and it still fails when I try to put in my kimlik number, seri number or passport number...useless...	2
10536	I cannot register	2
10537	Has this app been used to trace any of the recent clusters in NSW or any of the cases in Victoria? I'm wondering if it is worthwhile having it constantly running in the background burning battery power. There doesn't seem to be any mention of the app being used in the news. Otherwise the app works fine.	2

10545	App running in background fine on day 1, day 2 and I'm seeing huge battery drain - 45% after 2 hours. Nothing else installed, nothing else updated since yesterday. I'm in the very high risk group, I need this app to work.	1
10546	Easy to use, doing my bit for the country	0
10547	I can't open app in my mobile?i don't know what happened	1
10548	Yo why does the app require use of Bluetooth??? It interferes with the signal of my other Bluetooth devices and causes them to keep cutting out. Can't you guys like i dunno, make it more user friendly if the whole of SG needs to use this app?	2
10549	Great!	0
10550	It's too sensitive for detecting people, who are actually far away (more than 5-6meter away)	2
10551	Not working	2
10552	I have a samaung a7 and The Battery draining started 7th of August. Needs to be looked at by the developers. Had to uninstall due to phone dangerously overheating ( too hot to hold). Untill this is fixed I will not be downloading it. And it's a shame because i liked the app. Please let every one know because im sure they'd like to keep themselves and their families safe	1
10553	Didn't work at first on Android 10. Worked after uninstalling and reinstalling. However, the app seems to crash regularly, asking to restart it. Totally useless.	2

10557	Access only if you give personal data. Why do I have to share my phone number to activate it and then give your Turkish ID number. For the function of the app it's not necessary at all! Take an example from Corona app in Germany. They can do it without data collection.	1

I use android, LG stylus. Thank you.	2

10578	Can't even open the app on a galaxy a5 (2017) really bad expireince i expect a bit of more fixes that i can even run the app	2

10595	Doesn't alert you to infected cases in your area. Drains battery pretty fast due to Bluetooth connection. Not sure how this app is supposed to work as there's not much info coming from it. Also don't think personal data will be a concern for public health measures if it means improvement for the app.	2
10596	I don't find it useful	1

10606	Love this app	0
10607	Looking good.	0
10608	Requires location service to be "on" to detect devices near you.. well I'm not going to use the app then. Make it useful with the location setting "off" and I will start to use it. I might not be sharing my location but I do not accept that it needs location access when it is not necessary. Bluetooth works just fine with location service off. I don't care that smittestop doesn't track my movements, but it enforces everyone to turn on location giving Google and other apps access to my location.	2

10612	Like others have mentioned my contact tracing doesn't work unless the app is open. I close the app and when I check back in there's a red warning sign and I have to reenable contact tracing. I have bluetooth and location services on. I have also checked via my phone settings->google-->Covid and the only time my phone has sought permissions is when I have opened the app and pressed enable (again!). I would like the app to work as it's a great tool!	2
10613	Not working on huawei p40. After keyin mobile number and not going through anymoee. Really appreciate if you can fix it as soon as possible. Thank you..	2
10614	App works great, phone verified instantly, doesn\u2019t drain battery. If you\u2019re worried about privacy I suggest going back to your home screen and deleting every other app on your phone too.  Whatever it takes to get out country running again.	0

10619	This app is power hungry and when everyone is under circuit breaker there is not much contact to trace anyway.	1
10620	The QR scanner cannot be used. Whenever I click on the QR scanner, it will have pop out say google play services need to update but my google play services is updated.	2
10621	How this app is called a perfect app. I don't understand this. This app is only gonna work where population is must below 1k & in a country like india how this app gonna help us???ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”	1
10622	This App is not opening from last 3 hours. I have to register my location. But app not working	2
10623	The app is good from the use I had of it. Unfortunately I had to delete the app as it was completely draining my battery (OnePlus 7Tpro) within a few hours of full charge. It would normally last more than a day per charge. My wife experienced the same issue (OnePlus 6T).	1
10624	Doesn't work on Huawei P40. Have to always 'open' it or restart phone...	2
10625	nice	0
10626	The app is very informative and user friendly. The best part is it was from a company here in the Philippines. Great job!	0
10627	This app cripples push notifications of other apps such as WhatsApp. After turning on TraceTogether, other apps does not receive push notifications until you open them. In addition, with TraceTogether running, my phone is unable to download or update any apps from playstore. The download/update will be stucked at 100% without installing them. Only way to make it work again is to force stop TraceTogether, restart phone then updates other apps.	2
10628	Excellent idea but unfortunately this app is not helping because it shows very few cases reported in radius alert. I have observed radius alert from last week that it shows less than 30 cases in Karachi and less than 10 cases in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.	0
10629	Good stuff	0
10630	Easy to install, hopefully we never need it. However feeling safer already. Now we need everyone to install it!!!	0
10631	The basic spelling (incomplete words) and bad grammar isn't a good start for faith in the app build. 'Nex' should of 'Next' and 'N' should be 'No'. Was no reviews carried out before publish?	1
10632	Keeps crashing after couple of days. Downloaded 5 times then end up uninstalling when it stops working. However my wife's has been working fine for a few months now, both of us on android. Why??	2
10633	Validation issue. Please fix asap	2
10634	Good	0
10635	- Heard this application uses battery life excessively - This appliation is still in need of an update - Have already settled the 'Data Validation Error ". For those whom are currently NSF's, they would need to input the Date of Issue from their pink Civi	2
10636	Using this app completely drains your battery and makes your phone overheat to bits.	1
10637	Extremely disappointed. More than 3 months since my initial feedback that the QR code scanning does not work on the Redmi 10x Pro phone and it remained unfixed after 3 new releases since then. All other QR code scanners work on this phone except the TraceTogether App. The developers just could not be bothered to fix this.	2
10638	Why is the app draining battery to the point where my phone is dead in 4 hours. I have uninstalled due to this....please fix	1
10639	Good initiative. However, despite the developer saying battery usage will be "marginally" higher, my personal experience says otherwise. I usually charge my phone first thing in the morning, about 7am. Previously, the battery level will drop to about 60% by 6pm. But with this app, the battery level is at 60% by noon!	1

10651	This latest iteration tells you how many people you have been in contact with. I tested it. Yesterday during my exercise the number of contacts increased by 14. I had walked continuous for 45 minutes, did not need to stop to cross road. I walk behind one person, until I was able to overtake. I did pass several people sitting at bus stops. We were told that contacts would be recorded based on within 2 metres for 1 minute. From my test, it would appear the time element is not working.	2
10652	viimeisin tarkistus altistumisille tehty yli kuukausi sitten.	1
10653	I tried to register so many times. But after i fill in the NRIC form and click the NEXT. App shows the message "Temporary unavailable We're really sorry. please try again later" I tried so many times during a few weeks. And even many times I did uninstall and install & try registration. But cannot finish the registration. Is this app no more valid? Is there any tip to solve this issue? --------------- After email conversation, issue was solved. Thanks	2

10657	Latest up date with a QR scanner but can't even scan any... keep saying not a QR code. Headache using it. Why did you take away to barcode which link to our infor ? At least we cannot scan QR and that can be scan by the duty security for safe entry and we don't have to rush into wallet to find IC for scanning	2

10666	couldn't make an account. i never received the OTP number, although my phone number is correct. please fix this issue. thankyou	2
10667	Does not give updated information.	1
10668	Since update, app is useless because of the ID verification has no options for United Kingdom residents and now can't get past that bit or use the app without the ID verification.	1

10715	When I downlaod the app and wanted to set up the app with my particular, i.e. name, IC no. . . The app will validated and respond that my IC no is wrong despite it is the correct data. I had done loading the app and repeat the set up process at least 4 times and still face the same problem. As for the OTP, it is the same too. Even though I had entered the correct OTP, the app still validated and said that the erong OTP had been entered. It is really fustrating depsite I had tried and tried.	2
10716	The apps keeps stopping and I can't even open it.	2
10717	Another LNP government fail.I have tried at least 20 times to register but every time I have been told I'm entering an 'invalid phone number' Rubbish. I will keep trying and if it does work I might adjust my stars but at this point it doesn't seem to be working at all for me. Note: tried my work phone also and having same issue.. maybe it's a traffic/server issue.	2
10718	Constant error message, synchronisation issues... Fails at its purpose.	2
10719	I wonder if theres a reason a notif needs to be present on the screen? It bothers me a lot and like everyone else I'm a bit hesitant about battery usage.	2
10720	Said my number was invalid!	2
10721	To me i can not see point of the app because any info you put into the app is based on you telling the truth i have been tested 2 time in week i can not see any info on that i had not to put in date birth or pps number so like all things in ireland its joke	0
10722	This app is good	0
10723	Update: After installing the app again on August 11th, it appears to be back working and stable again. Excessive battery drain resolved. Since August 8th this app and Google Play Services are chewing up battery! I'm going to have to uninstall it, I'm losing a percent of battery every 3-4 minutes. The battery usage apps overview shows both this app and Google Play Services (which is tied to the app) as being the biggest battery offenders, using over 45% of the battery in the past 24 hours.	1

10736	May have damaged my phone. I have the new Samsung A31. I set up the phone with all my old apps, including the Covid app; I then had issues with the camera and the phone freezing. After factory resetting it, it worked fine. I installed each app one at a time and the issues reappeared after the Covid app was installed. I have a replacement phone now and, while I believe in the importance of the app, I'm afraid to install it should it damage my new phone...	1
10737	After installing multiple time, the OTP pin can’t be received as it shows that there's an error to generate OTP.\nPlease correct this error as without it , I cannot sign it.	2

10759	The application cannot be open because it keep on crashing. I called 109, advice to just wait for an hour or try in the morning to register because the system had a technical problem. If it's not working uninstall the apps and reinstall again the apps and try to register. I tried many times But still not working. Found out that their latest update v8.0.0 is not compatible with Android 10. So how I can install the previous app that works for Android 10.	2

10764	Is this app is only for Israel? That's too bad, I thought it's for global use. Good initiative though.	1
10765	Excellent	0
10766	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0
10767	Please improve the apps to have it OFF when not in USE such as at home rather then pause for 8hr as the apps and bluetooth are running the Phone Battery and Data which is a waste of $ as you do not need to trace in at your own HOME	1
10768	I think my Phone got COVID. The phone was getting really hot (High Temp) and the battery was draining really quickly (No energy). Had to remove the App (Self Isolated). Phone is back to normal since I removed it. This only began on Saturday 08/08/20.	1

10772	Nice app	0
10773	It needs to run in the background with Bluetooth always turned on leading to high battery usage. For someone who doesn't have a charger or power bank handy, this is very inconvenient. In its current state, the app shouldn't be made the only app for scanning SafeEntry QR codes.	1
10774	Do you really need a 10 digit password? After unsuccessfully attempting 3 times I gave up. Post message. Thanks for your response, however, a 10 digit password is near impossible for someone who has mild Dyslexia. This problem has not been considered. I won’t be downloading a 10 digit password app	1

10785	Why the app needs permission to storage? Lot of people concerned about their privacy. If we deny permission to storage. The app doesnt work. People are forced to buy a new phone for this app which doesnt have their private files. As the app made mandatory for all. I request the developers to make an update and drop the permission to the storage please. Also it drains the battery so fast.	1

10813	Hi, after recent few updates, I noticed the battery drain on my Samsung s20+ is of a concern. My phone would be at 81% when I go to bed and when I wake up 7 hrs later, the battery would drop to 34%. This is in stand by mode. Please find out the issue.	1
10814	Causes major connectivity issues with my Bluetooth devices, constantly makes my head phones and fitbit conect and reconnect at some points getting so bad (even when no one else is around) that i had to turn off the app. Also not a fan of the notification doesnt really need to be there constantly to do it job the app is doing that.	1

10846	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0

10876	This is an important app, which everyone with a compatible device should be using to help protect others, and the economy. The design for privacy is very good, and it's open-source for transparency.	0
10877	The only thing i have herd everyone complain about is the constant notification so just do an update and get rid of it. Spoken to heaps of people that deleted it after day because of a notification that doesn't need to be there.	1
10878	Random red expositions notifications come up every other day, even when I stayed alone at home for 3 days in a row. Thankfully, once I check, the notification has dissapeared and the app says everything is all right. Giving false alerts like that, and similar behaviours, makes me want to uninstall the app or disable the notifications altogether. That's really counter-productive. Other than that, and it's not so much about the app. But I had to buy a new smartphone to be able to use it properly. The concept that everybody has a good enough smartphone and can enable bluetooth all the time is not realistic.	2

10884	Excellent app	0
10885	Suggest to improvise the app to boost more related tracing features such as to be able to use it to scan SafeEntry QR code, lock the location then if the subject leaves that location, reminds him to check-out. And, to sound an alert when the subject goes to a location a confirmed case had visited with date and time.	2
10886	Easy to install and easy to use. All info are stored encrypted on phone. Great initiative! People should be less sensitive about giving this a go. Facebook and google track our every moves and yet everyone voluntarily give them a green light. Give this a chance to work! Not every app will be perfectly run the first time :) patience!	0

10908	Bluetooth Range. Class 2 (the most common kind) operate up to 10m (33ft), and class 3 are the least powerful and don't go much beyond 1m (3.3ft). Why not use mobile data to monitor the entire city, country or world?	2

10921	Poor, unable set pin after a number of attempts.	2
10922	App reports green and working in status bar, but when I tap on the app status, it opens showing it's not working because either GPS or Bluetooth is turned off, and I did not turn either of these off. Confusing. Concerning more so because I discover this halfway through or after a day out!! If mine doesn't work reliably, does anyone else's? If it's not working reliably for everyone what's the protection level? I supported and pushed the concept of this app and still do. Get your act together!	1
10923	Downloaded this Thursday and ever since iv download it it interfers with my bluetooth devices as well as my tap n go on my phone not downloading it again till this problem is fixed	1

10926	Need to improve alot	1
10927	Automatically turns my Bluetooth and wifi ON, it consumes battery. Concerns regarding privacy issues as the app asks permission to your media files.	1
10928	The application gives me an error that my phone is rooted even my phone is not rooted	2

10932	how come on iphone, trace together app can create group login in, and not on android platform ?	2
10933	Sometimes I forget to turn Bluetooth back on again after I have turned it off. I think it would be good if the app sent me an SMS or email reminder eg hourly to turn Bluetooth on again if I have forgotten to turn Bluetooth on again. Cheers.	1

10937	Respect for privacy? How? It requires location services to be on all of the time, giving tracking company Google (and many other apps) continued access to my location. How is that privacy?	2
10938	Keep crashing, I can't open the app	2
10939	Deleting this app due to the recent news that this apps data was "incidently" collected by intelligence agencies for 6 months when they not supposed too!! I now feel that our privacy is not safe with this government's app and handling of this data leak.	1
10940	Hi, i did not receive any OTP code for verification. i tried a few times.	2
10941	i feel be safe	0
10942	This app was sold to us as a means to prevent us from being locked up like cattle. So I'm deleting it until the government comes to their senses. Also it uses too much battery and apparently hasn't found a single contact in the latest outbreak.	1

10949	Phone number invalid (regardless of whether you have a 0 in front or not)	2
10950	Zero bluetooth exchanges ever since update! Stop asking users to write in to the email or try with family members! We have tried and found the problem to persists regardless what we do. Reinstallation means losing ALL records! Do not do so if you are at risk of exposure!	2

10962	Staysafe App is really an awesome contact tracing app! My utmost admiration to the developers for its remarkable and very accurate contact tracing features. It keeps me from paranoia because of its capabilities. It makes me feel safe. No doubt why this was chosen by the Philippine Government to be the official Contact Tracing App. I hightly recommend this app to every Filipino Citizen to be used daily. Download, register and Stay Safe!	0
10963	It severely screws up all my audio that goes through bluetooth connections. Ear phones, car's head unit, bluetooth speakers, you name it. Using this App on a samsung S10+.	2

10969	User friendly app	0
10970	It is very usefull	0
10971	I had no trouble installing the app and recommend everybody doing it. BUT it isn't compatible with my wife's Samsung running Android 5.1.1. I'll bet there are millions of people in that position. Unless the app is capable of working on those phones there's not much chance of us reaching the number of installs required by the Govt.	2
10972	Complete joke	1
10973	Unable to login in app showing error connection. Kindly, check the bug.	1
10974	I had to uninstall the app as its Bluetooth frequencies made my HPB issued watch unable to sync to phone. Hope admin can look into this.	2
10975	This app does not alert to not being active or requiring an update unless you actually open it...should be better than this.. Update 21 12 20 just got my 1st alert to an update being available..much better	2
10976	Uninstalled the app due to the mandatory SafeEntry check in and out.	2
10977	Goood	0
10978	I've install this apps since yesterday but there's pop up msgs error in entering mobile number till today. Will it be fix soon?	2
